The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed more than 0.2% to notch a record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.2%.The move higher came on the heels of small gains for stocks on Wall Street on Tuesday.The waiting game is on for Nvidia's quarterly results, slated to arrive after the bell. Investor hopes for the world's most valuable company are sky-high, with the AI chip giant expected to post record-high revenue and adjusted profit for the second quarter.But investors are watching for the fallout from President Trump's curbs on China chip sales, which Nvidia forecast will deliver an $8 billion hit to its quarterly bottom line. More widely, the Big Tech bellwether's earnings are a big test for the broader AI trade that has driven the bull market in stocks. Traders are pricing in a swing of roughly 6% \u2014 or about $260 billion \u2014 in Nvidia shares after its report, options showed.Read more: Live coverage of corporate earningsWhile stock markets largely shrugged off Trump's move to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook on allegations of mortgage fraud, some small signs of stress are showing in bonds. Two-year Treasury yields were up just two points after sliding to 3.65% \u2014 their lowest since May \u2014 even as 30-year yields (^TYX) stay atop 4.9%.On the trade front, the European Union is looking to fast-track the removal of tariffs on all US industrial goods, Bloomberg reported, clearing the way for an easing of duties on EU auto imports in return. Meanwhile, Trump's hefty 50% tariffs on Indian products kicked in on Wednesday, in reprisal for India's purchases of Russian oil. Crude prices oil (CL=F, BZ=F) edged higher after a 2% slide the prior session.Meanwhile, Cracker Barrel (CBRL) stock continued to rise after the company bowed to calls from Trump and the public that it should never have scrapped its old logo.Nvidia (NVDA) stock slid more than 2% in after-hours trading after the company beat on earnings but missed on data center revenue for its second quarter, revenue forecast omits H20 shipments to China.The AI giant posted adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share versus expectations of $1.01.Data center revenue was $41.1 billion, slightly below Wall Street consensus estimates of $41.23 billion, according to Bloomberg data.Additionally, the company's revenue forecast for the third quarter of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, does not assume any H20 shipments to China. The omission underscores the uncertainty hanging over US chipmakers amid Washington's trade tensions with Beijing.The US has allowed Nvidia to send China its H20 chips, which are less powerful next-generation Blackwell technology, in exchange for a cut of the company's revenue. However, China's government has advised domestic companies to use alternative chipmakers.Nvidia stock has rallied roughly 35% year to date to lead the AI tech trade.Going into Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) earnings after the bell, Wall Street will be closely watching the chipmaker\u2019s performance in one of its key markets: China.Nvidia was hit with a surprise export ban on sales of its H20 chips to China in April \u2014 a move that was set to cost the chipmaker $8 billion in lost sales in its second quarter. In yet another unexpected move, the Trump administration said in July it would grant Nvidia export licenses for its H20 chips in exchange for 15% of the revenue from those sales \u2014 an agreement likely to face legal challenges due to the US Constitution\u2019s ban on export taxes.The reversal of the ban could help Nvidia recoup as much as $15 billion in revenue from China in the second half of the year to hit around $20 billion from the region for its 2026 fiscal year, which ends next January. That would be an uptick from its roughly $17 billion in sales from China in 2025.But analysts have moderated their optimism over any uplift from Nvidia\u2019s sales to China headed into Wednesday\u2019s report, with Stifel analyst Ruben Roy noting their could be \u201cnear-term speed bumps\u201d related to Nvidia\u2019s position in that market.That\u2019s because Nvidia has reportedly asked its suppliers to halt production of components for its H20 chips. The news came after conflicting reports over whether China is ordering companies to stop buying Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips. The Information reported earlier this month that China\u2019s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, issued a directive to tech companies to suspend their purchases of Nvidia\u2019s chips. But the same day, a Reuters report said authorities were questioning Chinese companies over their orders of H20 chips, not ordering them to stop those purchases.More will be revealed in short order.Nvidia (NVDA) stock was steady with less than one hour of trading before the close as investors awaited the AI chip giant's highly anticipated earnings.Nvidia has been the poster child of the artificial intelligence trade. The stock has rallied roughly 35% year-to-date to lead this year's market rally.Yahoo Finance plans to interview Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at 6:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, following the company's earnings call.Cryptocurrencies were rallying on Wednesday, with ethereum (ETH-USD) continuing to lead the charge, rising more than 2.5%, among the major cryptocurrencies, while bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ripple's XRP (XRP-USD) also rose.Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, has staged a stunning comeback this year, surging more than 200% from April lows compared to a 45% rise in bitcoin during the same period.Ether briefly hit a new all-time high Sunday, topping $4,900, as a dovish speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell late last week lifted broader markets, with crypto continuing this rally into the weekend.Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still down about 10% from its mid-August all-time high north of $124,000.Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is bracing for the impact of higher tariffs, including a 50% US levy on its Indian imports.\"Our impact between the whole network is just under $200 million,\" CEO Robert Ford said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (video above). \"But I think the key thing here, one thing that we have learned, is once tariffs come into place, whether in the United States or in another country, they do not go away.\"Ford added the healthcare company is finding ways to mitigate the tariffs, including making long-term investments in manufacturing and supply chains.Read more here. Shares of Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) climbed 6% on Wednesday after the bank reported strong results across all three of its business segments.RBC's diluted earnings per share of $3.75 and revenue of $16.99 billion topped Wall Street estimates.The Canadian Press reports:The bank's personal banking segment reported net income of $1.9 billion, up $352 million or 22 per cent from a year earlier. Its commercial banking division reported a net income of $836 million, up $19 million or two per cent from the same quarter last year.RBC Wealth Management reported a net income of $1.1 billion, up $147 million or 15 per cent from last year.

You might not be alone, Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma writes.The stock was up more than 8% in afternoon trading on Wednesday.Brooke reports on Wall Street's reaction to the logo reversal:In a client note published Wednesday, Citi's Jon Tower said the \"late August hubbub\" over the brand could actually benefit the business in the near term.\"While the lasting impact on the business is unclear, this late August hubbub has drawn attention ... growing attention does not always translate into consistent visits nor solve the brand's longer-term issues around relevancy to younger consumers, but could spark curiosity and visits near-term as consumers determine what all the ballyhoo was all about,\" he wrote in a note to clients.Tower said that searches for \"Cracker Barrel\" hit a record high on Google over the past week.Read more here.IonQ (IONQ) shares jumped nearly 3% after B Riley Securities analyst Craig Ellis initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating.Ellis said he believes \"quantum computing will increasingly solve problems once considered classically intractable in the next five to 10 year\" and that \"IONQ could be a leader, likely accruing significant value as its capabilities mature.\"He noted that IonQ has sold quantum computers since 2021, has brought online 10 quantum computing systems, and was the first quantum computing system available on all three major cloud providers \u2014 Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT).IonQ stock has surged 474% over the past 12 months but has had a volatile 2025, up just 0.4% year to date, as skepticism over quantum technologies and mounting losses in its most recent quarter put pressure on shares.UnitedHealth Group shares rose 1% Wednesday, holding steady despite a Bloomberg report that the US Department of Justice's criminal probe into the insurer is wider than previously thought.Bloomberg reported that the DOJ's criminal division is investigating UnitedHealth's prescription management segment, Optum Rx, in addition to potential Medicare fraud. News of the initial investigation was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in May.Shares of UNH are still down 40% for the year amid regulatory scrutiny, a shake-up among top executives, and broader industry pressures.American Eagle (AEO) shares jumped as much as 5% after announcing a collaboration with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, a day after the football player announced his engagement to Taylor Swift.The limited edition collaboration featuring lifestyle and sportswear is called \"AE x Tru Kolors by Travis Kelce.\" Kelce also stars in the ad campaign for the new line.Even with Wednesday's gain, American Eagle stock is down 23% in 2025 as the apparel maker has reported declines in revenue and earnings per share in its last three quarterly earnings reports.Meanwhile, shares of rival Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) traded flat on Wednesday after the company reported earnings that topped expectations but showed a decline in net sales in its Abercrombie brand.US stocks traded mixed at the open of Wednesday's trading session as investors awaited Nvidia's (NVDA) highly anticipated earnings report after the bell.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up nearly 0.1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell below the flat line and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dipped 0.15%.The mixed open comes on the heels of small gains for stocks on Wall Street on Tuesday.Bond yields continued to push higher on Wednesday following President Trump's move to oust Fed governor Lisa Cook, which was marked by a relatively tame market reaction.While short-term yields slipped lower, concerns about eroding Fed independence and tariffs pushed long-run yields higher as fears grew that the pressure on the Fed could lead to inflation running hotter over time.The 10-year yield (^TNX) moved up 3 basis points to 4.28%, while the 30-year yield (^TYX) rose 4 basis points to hold above 4.95%.The Treasury yield curve also steepened to the highest level since April. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yield now stands at 62 basis points.Nvidia (NVDA) stock gained 0.5% in premarket trading ahead of its earnings release after the closing bell on Wednesday. The AI chipmaker will round out Big Tech earnings after a quarter of back-and-forth with the Trump administration.Yahoo Finance's Daniel Howley notes that investors will be on the lookout for continued shipment scaling of Nvidia's GB200 super chip, the ramp of its upcoming Blackwell Ultra chip, AI spending, and commentary on China sales during the company's earnings call on Wednesday.Options traders expect Nvidia's market value to swing about $260 billion after its second quarter earnings, suggesting investors feel more certain about the company's performance.Read Dan's full preview of Nvidia earnings here.Goldman Sachs expects the price of Brent (BZ=F) crude futures contracts to fall to the low $50s a barrel by late 2026, its analysts said in a note to clients.An increase in the oil surplus next year will drive the decline from current levels, Goldman said, amid reduced demand in leading economies.Oil prices steadied after Tuesday's steep drop as traders assessed the start of 50% US tariffs on Indian goods, a reprisal for its imports of Russian crude.Indian government estimates suggest global crude prices could more than triple to around $200 a barrel if the country stops buying oil from Russia, Reuters reported.Kohl's (KSS) raised its full-year profit forecast on Wednesday, in a sign that the department store chain's turnaround push is paying off.Shares surged over 15% in premarket trading as investors welcomed the retailer's earnings report, which eased worries over Kohl's warning on Tuesday that it was seeking more time to pay vendors.Kohl's has downsized its jewelry business among other moves to rein in costs, while it has also stepped up efforts to draw in shoppers during the key holiday season.Reuters reports:Kohl's expects annual earnings per share of 50 cents to 80 cents, compared with its earlier wide range of 10 cents to 60 cents.\"We were able to expand our gross margins, reduce our inventory, and lower our expenses, leading to solid second-quarter earnings,\" said interim-CEO Michael Bender.Kohl's second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 56 cents handily beat estimates of 29 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.For the quarter ended August 2, comparable sales fell 4.2%, smaller than estimates of a 5% decline.Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Aug. 22)Earnings: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M.

The 10-year (^TNX) meandered down a hair. And longer-dated US bond prices rose only slightly, even as concerns mounted that Trump's moves against the Federal Reserve's independence could stoke inflation and instability.The reaction was nothing like the post-\"Liberation Day\" sell-off. Back then, the bond market strong-armed the president into backing away from his most punishing tariff policies.But this time, as the president attempts to fire a Federal Reserve governor, Wall Street appears largely unbothered. What changed?Part of the answer has to do with timing. Right now, in the short term, the interests of the three main players \u2014 the Fed, the president, and the market \u2014 are all very much aligned.As economists Stephen Brown and Thomas Ryan from Capital Economics put it in a note on Tuesday, \"It remains unclear whether Trump\u2019s letter firing Cook, posted on social media [Monday], will have any practical effect on policy setting in the near term.\" ...But even when markets tolerate a legally dubious but aligned maneuver, what happens in the longer run should the Fed see itself remade as a political entity?Read more here.Shares of MongoDB (MDB) surged over 30% in premarket trading following surprising momentum in the database software provider's subscription revenue.The company posted strong quarterly results on Tuesday, driven by accelerating revenue growth in its Atlas cloud database service and new customer acquisition.In the second quarter, overall revenue rose 24% year over year to $591.4 million. MongoDB reported a loss per share of $0.58. Both metrics surpassed Wall Street's estimates for revenue of $553 million and a loss of $0.85 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\"Many of our recently added customers are building AI applications, underscoring how our value proposition is resonating in the AI era and why MongoDB is emerging as a key component of the AI infrastructure stack,\" MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria said.Here's a look at some of the top stocks trending in premarket trading:Cracker Barrel (CBRL) stock rose 6% before the bell on Wednesday after the company reverted back to its old logo due to consumer backlash and pressure from President Trump.\u201cWe thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel.

You have the situation where President Trump is utilizing energy, oil to negotiate and imposing these secondary tariffs because he's saying if you are purchasing Russian oil, then you are essentially helping fund the war in Ukraine. So this is a way for India to stop buying Russian oil for Russia to have less funds to fund the war in Ukraine and it is also a sort of negotiating tactic that analysts see for India to come to the negotiating table as well. So, one analyst is saying that while India would come to the negotiating table with these 25% additional tariffs that are placed, he's saying that the in the near term, the crude market is sort of shrugging this off. We have seen oil going a bit higher in some of these sessions and that is because some uh oil targets, energy targets, Russian energy targets uh have been hit by uh by Ukraine. So that is why we have seen some of the volatility that we've seen with oil, but if you take a look at uh oil year to date, you are still seeing that oil is down 13% uh for WTI, Brent crude down uh more than 11% and what would really send oil prices lower is of course, if you uh also saw the uh war uh end as well. So, this is right now the market is sort of shrugging off uh these tariffs and doesn't expect the war to end anytime soon.Yeah, and Ines, we're looking at Brent crude trading at just around 66 bucks a barrel, but Goldman Sachs out with a new note this morning saying that it expects the price of Brent to decline to about $50 a barrel. That's by late 2026. So what's behind the call there?Yeah, so what they're saying is is that this is all being driven by oil surplus, that you are going to have much more oil in the market than needed, that global inventories are going to rise to, they're expecting 800 million barrels by the end of 2026. There is an upward upside risk to these prices and that is if China starts to accelerate more of their oil stockpiling, then you could see Brent actually a little bit higher than than that at $62 per barrel for the average for 2026. But if you take a look across the board at where Wall Street is expecting oil to land next year, you are seeing JP Morgan that's expecting Brent to average $58 per barrel in 2026. Then you have the EIA that is expecting $51 per barrel in 2026. OPEC Plus has been increasing its production. We see we're seeing this oil surplus and the expectation is a downward trend for oil from here from the fourth quarter of this year and into 2026. They're expecting to see lower oil prices.", "analysis": 2}, "3": {"title": "Energy & Utilities Roundup: Market Talk", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a5e385e9-965b-3c0e-851d-9fc5f526afcf/energy-utilities-roundup-.html", "date": "2025-08-28T10:37:00+00:00", "body": "Find insight on Cnooc, QL Resources, Karoon Energy and more in the latest Market Talks covering energy and utilities.", "analysis": 1}, "4": {"title": "Exclusive-India\u2019s Russian oil imports set to rise in September in defiance of US", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-india-russian-oil-imports-103602322.html", "date": "2025-08-28T10:36:02+00:00", "body": "MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) -Russian oil exports to India are set to rise in September, traders said, as producers cut prices to sell more crude because they cannot process as much in refineries that were damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks on energy infrastructure.India has become the biggest buyer of Russian oil supplies that were displaced by Western sanctions after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.

But with no formal U.S. rules in place and questions about whether Chinese regulators will discourage purchases of Nvidia chips, the AI market bellwether excluded potential China sales from the forecast for the current quarter.Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company will ship between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue in the current quarter, if geopolitical issues were to subside. But the outlook on China still remained highly uncertain.\u00a0U.S. stock futures traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq underperforming after the release of results from AI darling Nvidia.\u00a0At 02:55 ET (06:55 GMT), the S&P 500 futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher and Dow futures rose 127 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 17 points, or 0.1%.The major indices enjoyed a winning session Wednesday, with the broad-based S&P 500 hitting a record close. They are on pace to record monthly gains, as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite are each up more than 2%, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 3% in the period.Aside from Nvidia\u2019s results, investors will also digest numbers from the likes of Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), while the economic data calendar includes the release of weekly initial jobless claims and gross domestic product growth for the second quarter.Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) sales and market share in Europe fell sharply in July, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association showed on Thursday, even as broader electric vehicle sales in the region continued to increase.Tesla\u2019s sales lagged those of Chinese rival BYD, which was included in the monthly sales data for the first time. The latter also seized a greater market share than Tesla.\u00a0Tesla\u2019s total new car registrations in the European Union, the Europe Free Trade Association, and in the U.K., slid just over 40% year-on-year, ACEA data showed.\u00a0The ACEA is a group of 15 European automakers that acts as the main lobbying and standards group for the bloc\u2019s automobile industry.\u00a0Tesla\u2019s market share in the region shrank further to 0.8% from 1.4% year-on-year, while its January-July sales declined by 33.6% from the same period last year.\u00a0The drop came even as total battery EV sales in Europe surged 33.6% in July. The sector now represents about 15.6% of the European car market, behind the 28.3% share held by petrol vehicles and 34.7% share held by hybrid EVs.\u00a0Tesla\u2019s updated Model Y, released earlier this year, has made little impact on its sales, while rival offerings from European automakers, who have jumped on the EV bandwagon in recent years, also provided increased competition.\u00a0Tesla\u2019s brand image has taken a hit in Europe, hurt by CEO Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement of U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as his associations with a German far right party.\u00a0Japan\u2019s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, has cancelled a visit to the United States at the last minute, delaying talks designed to finalise a $550 billion investment package offered by Tokyo in exchange for relief on punishing tariffs.\"It was found that there are points that need to be discussed at the administrative level during coordination with the American side. Therefore, the trip has been cancelled,\" Japan\u2019s government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters on Thursday.Washington and Tokyo agreed in July to set a reduced 15% tariff on imports from Japan in exchange for the package of U.S.-bound investment through government-backed loans and guarantees, but details of its contents remain unclear.While Trump has touted the package as \"our money to invest\" and said the U.S. would retain 90% of the profits earned, Japanese officials have stressed that the investments will be determined based on whether they will also benefit Japan.Oil prices fell on expectations for lower U.S. fuel demand as the summer driving season draws near, even after a sharp drop in U.S. crude inventories.At 02:55 ET, Brent futures slipped 0.5% to $66.91 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.9% to $63.59 a barrel.Both contracts climbed in the prior session after the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended August 22, a larger draw than the 1.9 million barrels forecast by analysts.The drop signaled strong demand ahead of the upcoming U.S. Labor Day long weekend.

U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to position himself as a mediator, but last week warned he would impose fresh sanctions on Moscow if no progress was made toward a peace deal within two weeks.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

(NYSE:TS) with a price target of $49.00, citing improved macroeconomic visibility for 2026. The target represents a significant upside from the current price of $36.11, with InvestingPro data showing the stock trading at an attractive P/E ratio of 9.8x and offering a robust 6.2% dividend yield.The research firm noted a shift in tone from Tenaris\u2019s management, observing that the company\u2019s second-quarter 2025 conference call on July 30 conveyed more optimism compared to the cautious stance during first-quarter discussions.Bernstein SocGen highlighted several potential positive catalysts for 2026, including PEMEX securing financing and launching a restructuring process, which suggests drilling activity could gradually recover next year.The firm also pointed to International Energy Agency expectations that Vaca Muerta production could increase by 60,000 barrels in 2026 from approximately 470,000 barrels in 2025, indicating a recovery in fracking activity.Tenaris now anticipates a firm pick-up in offshore activity in 2026, supported by potential offshore Final Investment Decisions in West Africa, East Mediterranean, Latin America, and Asia, according to the research note.In other recent news, Piper Sandler has taken a cautious stance on the Oilfield Services sector, highlighting TechnipFMC as a top pick among its peers. The firm identified TechnipFMC, Tenaris, and Baker Hughes as stocks expected to outperform, despite recent challenges in the oil markets. This analysis comes amid a downturn in oil prices, which has resulted in downward earnings revisions across the industry. The decline in oil prices is partly attributed to increased production by OPEC+ and other macroeconomic factors. Piper Sandler\u2019s outlook is based on their oil price shock playbook, which has been employed to navigate recent market volatility. The firm notes that TechnipFMC has emerged as a relative outperformer, experiencing a smaller decline compared to its peers.

comes amid market worries over a spending bubble in the artificial intelligence sector that could burst and hurt the chip giant's fortunes.\"The market seems to be asking whether Nvidia can keep up this pace as competition intensifies and AI enthusiasm starts to look a little overbought,\" said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at traders Scope Markets.Investors were also reacting to US data showing that the world's biggest economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter, up from an initial estimate of 3.0 percent in July.\"After the initial release, there were concerns that the domestic economy was slowing quite sharply,\" said Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm.\"But these latest data suggest that the economy is a bit stronger than initially feared,\" he said.The upward revision mainly reflected improvements in investment and consumer spending, the Commerce Department said.But overall, growth in the second quarter was also bolstered by a fall in US imports, which are subtracted from the GDP.This drop came as businesses pulled back on shipments after rushing to stock up ahead of US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes.The data could offer insight into the outlook for US interest rates, with the Federal Reserve eyeing further cuts to borrowing costs in a bid to boost the US economy.\"Overall, this release probably doesn't change Federal Reserve thinking too much,\" Flax said, adding that the central bank was still expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting.\"But a stronger than expected result from domestic demand suggests that there might not be that much scope to cut rates over the next 12 months.\"In Europe, the Paris stock market extended its recovery, having tumbled early in the week on fears that France's

The largest has come in France, where Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has called a confidence vote for September 8 that many expect him to lose.The closely-watched spread France pays over Germany for 10-year debt held at 78 basis points on Friday, having soared over the last fortnight.. Investors were also digesting moderately higher inflation numbers from France and from key parts of Germany.A UK bank share index fell 4.4% meanwhile after an influential think tank suggested the cash-strapped government there could begin taxing banks based on their Bank of England reserves.Asia had been mixed overnight with Chinese shares clocking up their best month in almost a year with a more than 10% gain on hopes that its economy, especially the tech sector, is picking up.Japan\u2019s heavyweight Nikkei ended down on the day, although it too has jumped 4% in August and both it and MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan are on an unbroken 5-month run of gains.One blip in China, where the yuan has also been on the charge, was a 1.7% pull back on the tech-focused STAR 50 Index after its near 30% boom this month.It came as shares in chip firm Cambricon Technologies dropped more than 6% as it issued an official risk alert over the more than doubling of its stock price since late July.\"Certainly, when you see such a very, very large move, and then some warning coming from the company, you could think that there has been a little bit of overshooting,\" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale.Stocks in Bangkok also fell 1.5% and the Thai baht eased 0.3% after the country\u2019s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was sacked for an ethics breach - a telephone call, during which she appeared to kowtow to Cambodia\u2019s powerful former leader Hun Sen.WAITING ON PCEThe broader market focus is now on the soon-to-be-released U.S. PCE price index data - the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation.Economists polled by Reuters expect the index to stay steady at 2.6% in July from the month before. Excluding volatile items like food and energy, however, the index is expected to rise 2.9%, up from 2.8% in June.Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ, said analysts would be looking to see whether the impact of trade tariff increases is starting to show.\"There are three important pieces of data ahead of the September FOMC.

The global benchmark has averaged around $70 so far this year.U.S. crude is seen at $64.65, compared with last month\u2019s $64.61 estimate.\"(With) the latest OPEC+ supply increases and the expected lackluster global demand, the prospect is for an even larger market surplus in 2025,\" said Moutaz Altaghlibi, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO.He said the outlook remains clouded by \"deep uncertainty\" concerning any additional U.S. tariffs, especially those associated with geopolitical outcomes such as an Iranian nuclear deal or Russia agreeing to a ceasefire.Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together known as OPEC+, agreed to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September.\"OPEC+ probably still has not reached the end of their output hikes. At the moment, market share seems to be more important than a higher level of oil prices,\" said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW.\"This will lead to a big supply surplus on oil markets in 2025 and 2026 and will keep prices down.\"Washington\u2019s attempts to broker peace in Ukraine with Moscow have so far proven unsuccessful. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed additional tariffs on India, pressuring New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil.Most of the poll respondents see limited impact on the oil market from Trump\u2019s threats on Russian crude buyers, as they expect OPEC+ and alternative suppliers could mitigate supply gaps.However, the geopolitical risk premium is expected to underpin oil prices as a quick Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal seems highly unlikely, analysts said.Global oil demand is seen growing by between 500,000 and 1.1 million bpd in 2025, the poll showed, compared to the International Energy Agency forecast of 680,000 bpd.Meanwhile, OPEC raised its global oil demand forecast for next year and trimmed its estimate for growth in supply from the U.S. and other producers outside the wider OPEC+ group.\"U.S. production is an interesting one as President Trump would like to push for more production, but OPEC+ may be right in their projections.

There are also inflation numbers in Europe to digest, while the Trump administration has ended its\u00a0\"de minimis\" exemption.Investors will focus on the release of the U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, later in the session, as they seek more clarity on the path for interest rates for the rest of the year.Expectations are for the core PCE to have stayed steady at 0.3% on a monthly basis, putting the annual rate at 2.9%.However, there is the risk the data may reveal more evidence of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs filtering into consumer prices, following a recent upside surprise in producer inflation.The Fed lowered its policy rate by a full percentage point last year, but has held rates steady this year, citing worries that Trump\u2019s higher tariffs could reignite inflation that is still running above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal.Expectations are rife this stance is set to end in September with a 25-basis-point cut, though what happens after that remains uncertain.Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Thursday he wants to start cutting rates next month and \"fully expects\" more rate cuts to follow to bring the Fed\u2019s policy rate closer to a neutral setting.Waller and Fed Governor Michelle Bowman both dissented from the Fed\u2019s decision to keep short-term borrowing costs unchanged in July.\u00a0Both were appointed by Trump and are said to be under consideration as possible successors to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, amid market concerns of the politicisation of the central bank.Trump earlier this week announced he was firing Fed Governor Lisa Cook over what he said was possible mortgage fraud, a move Cook says is illegal and is suing to stop.U.S. stock futures slipped marginally lower, but remained on course for healthy monthly gains ahead of the release of important inflation data.\u00a0At 03:20 ET (07:20 GMT), the S&P 500 futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, lower Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 35 points, or 0.1%, and Dow futures fell 80 points, or 0.2%.The major indices enjoyed a winning session on Thursday, with the S&P 500 closing up 0.3% at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite added 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up about 0.2%, also a new record.They are also all on track for solid monthly gains, with the 30-stock Dow having logged a 3.4% advance so far in August. The S&P 500 is up 2.6% so far this month, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained 2.8%.Investors will focus on key inflation data later in the session, with the release of the July personal consumption expenditures index [see above].\u00a0Investors will also digest results from the likes of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) and  Affirm Holdings  (NASDAQ:AFRM).The Trump administration on Friday ended U.S. duty-free imports of packages worth less than $800, the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption that has fueled a surge in shipments from global sellers to U.S. consumers.President Donald Trump announced on July 30 the repeal of duty-free treatment of parcels from every country effective a month later, saying the exemption has enabled traffickers to easily send parcels containing fentanyl into the country.\u00a0However, the de minimis exemption enabled a cross-border ecommerce surge, with 1.36 billion shipments arriving under de minimis with a declared value of $64.6 billion in fiscal 2024.According to U.S. government data, about 73% of de minimis packages entering the U.S. originated from China in 2024.U.S. consumers are now likely to face higher prices, with the tariffs makng shipments to the U.S. from overseas retailers more expensive, unless the sellers absorb the tariff costs.There are also important inflation numbers due in Europe during the session, with preliminary French, Spanish and German consumer prices in the spotlight.The European Central Bank left its key rate at 2% at its July meeting, and data since then has confirmed the eurozone economy was holding up while inflation hovered at the ECB\u2019s 2% target.ECB policymakers are widely expected to hold rates unchanged again in September, but the minutes from the July meeting showed that they were divided on whether inflation was more likely to come in higher or lower moving forward, a foretaste of a debate set to come to a head in the coming months.A key element generating uncertainty is the impact of the U.S. tariffs on the European economies, after the Trump administration announced the imposition of 15% duties on EU goods imports.The ECB policymakers acknowledged this uncertainty \"would remain a key feature of the global and euro area economic outlook for some time to come\", but they disagreed on how big its impact would be on the economy.Oil prices slipped lower, but are set for a weekly gain, as traders weigh uncertainty over Russian supply as well as the proximity to the end of the important U.S. summer driving season.At 03:20 ET, Brent futures slipped 0.7% to $67.54 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.7% to $64.12 a barrel.Both contracts are on course for weekly gains of just under 1%, with prices gaining after Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil export terminals raised doubts about Russian supply, while the lack of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised doubts about the peace process.However, the end of the U.S. summer driving demand period with the Labor Day holiday on Monday have weighed on prices.On a broader scale, both contracts are set for monthly losses of over 6%, dragged by steady production hikes by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.(Reuters contributed reporting.)\u00a0ProPicks AI evaluates ULTA alongside thousands of other companies every month using 100+ financial metrics.

The move reflects seasonal factors such as the end of the U.S. summer driving season, alongside the ongoing uncertainty around tariffs on Indian exports and sanctions on Russian crude. These crosscurrents continue to inject unpredictability into the energy market.For investors, such volatility makes picking stable energy plays even more critical. High-yielding, large-cap energy stocks \u2014 defined as companies with a market capitalization of $10 billion or more \u2014 often provide a cushion against turbulent markets, as their scale and cash generation can support dividends through cycles. In particular, companies like Canadian Natural Resources Limited CNQ, Chevron CVX, and Kinder Morgan KMI stand out for maintaining yields above 4%. These payouts not only reward patient investors but also signal balance sheet strength and operational resilience.Well-established energy giants bring financial resilience, global recognition and strong analyst coverage to the table. Their steady dividend payouts add to the appeal, particularly for investors focused on reliable income. For anyone seeking consistency and a long-term track record of performance, these large-cap names remain a compelling choice.While they may not deliver the explosive growth that smaller firms occasionally achieve, large-cap stocks provide a cushion against volatility. This balance of stability and dependable returns makes them especially suited for investors looking to avoid the sharp swings often seen in commodity-driven markets.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCanadian Natural Resources: It is one of Canada\u2019s largest independent energy companies, with a broad portfolio spanning crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

Whether you are debating a new buy, holding steady, or even considering trimming your stake, the stock\u2019s latest action has likely caught your attention. After a choppy start to the year, ConocoPhillips closed at $98.97 recently and has put together a modest 2.3% gain over the last week, alongside a 6.7% lift in the past month. The broader outlook is more nuanced, with shares slipping 1.1% year to date and down 10.2% over the last year, yet up an impressive 231.4% across five years. Some of these moves can be traced to shifting oil prices and new optimism over global demand, as markets keep recalibrating their expectations for energy producers like ConocoPhillips.Valuation matters, and ConocoPhillips currently earns a value score of 4 out of 6, which indicates it is undervalued in four different assessment checks. But what does that really mean for your portfolio? Here is a closer look at each of the major ways stocks like this are valued, followed by a consideration of whether there might be an even smarter approach waiting at the end.Why ConocoPhillips is lagging behind its peersThe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today\u2019s dollar value. This approach aims to gauge what the business is truly worth on a standalone basis, regardless of temporary market ups and downs.For ConocoPhillips, the current Free Cash Flow sits at $8.64 Billion. Analysts forecast the company\u2019s annual cash flows to grow, with projections reaching $9.98 Billion by 2029. Looking further ahead, extended estimates suggest that by 2035, ConocoPhillips could be generating over $12.75 Billion a year in free cash. These projections are based on both analyst estimates for the next five years as well as automated extrapolations beyond that. All of these figures feed into the company\u2019s DCF valuation.Taking these numbers into account, the DCF model calculates ConocoPhillips\u2019 intrinsic value at $193.21 per share. With the stock trading at $98.97, this model suggests the shares are trading at a 48.8% discount to their underlying value.Result: UNDERVALUEDHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for ConocoPhillips.Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests ConocoPhillips is undervalued by 48.8%.

While this Canadian energy giant traded at $22.84 at the last close, the real question is whether those shares are actually a bargain or not. The stock has experienced its share of ups and downs recently, rising 0.7% in the last week and 11.8% over the past month. Long-term investors who have held Cenovus for the past five years are up 317.0%. However, those who started investing just one year ago may feel less enthusiastic, as the stock is down 5.2% over that period. Part of this volatility appears tied to shifting market perceptions around oil prices and the broader energy sector, with investors reacting to global supply changes and hints of future demand. There is a sense that the risk profile for Canadian energy players like Cenovus is evolving, contributing to some of these rapid moves both up and down. Is Cenovus actually undervalued? After running the company through six key valuation checks, it receives a value score of 3. This means it appears undervalued in three out of six major categories, which may be considered a solid result for bargain hunters, though not definitive. To better understand what this score means for your Cenovus holding, it is helpful to look more closely at these valuation methods, examine what they indicate about the stock today, and consider a more comprehensive approach to valuation that goes beyond the numbers. Why Cenovus Energy is lagging behind its peersA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model attempts to estimate a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting those figures back to their value in today's terms. This helps investors determine what a company may truly be worth, beyond the day-to-day movement in its share price.For Cenovus Energy, the most recent reported Free Cash Flow is CA$3.77 billion. Analysts project steady FCF growth over time, with forecasts reaching CA$5.82 billion by 2028. Looking further out, extrapolated estimates suggest FCF could surpass CA$12.15 billion by 2035. These longer-term projections rely on a blend of analyst insights and calculated growth rates provided by financial platforms, including Simply Wall St.Based on the DCF model used, the estimated intrinsic value for Cenovus shares is CA$134.07. With the stock currently trading at CA$22.84, this implies a substantial 83.0% discount to fair value.

In 2007, for instance, Exxon stock traded at roughly $85 per share. In 2016, nearly a decade later, shares still traded at roughly $85 per share.The past five years, however, have been very different. Exxon shareholders have crushed the market. You may be surprised to learn just how much a $1,000 investment would have become since the summer of 2020.As one of the largest oil stocks in the world, Exxon is heavily dependent on the prevailing price of oil. Five years ago arguably marks the nadir of the oil price collapse that occurred due to uncertainty surrounding the ongoing global pandemic. In April of 2020, oil prices fell as low as $20 per barrel! By August of that year, prices had already rebounded to around $40 per barrel, but that was still one-third below pre-pandemic levels.Today, oil prices hover just above $60 per barrel due to rising costs and geopolitical tensions. Today's price level is roughly 50% higher than it was five years ago, but Exxon's stock price has risen significantly more.If you had invested $1,000 into Exxon stock in August 2020, you'd have around $3,460 today. That figure includes dividend income -- an important consideration given Exxon currently pays a dividend yield of 3.5%. Over the same time period, a $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 would have grown into just $2,000.Much of this outperformance stems from Exxon's continued investments throughout the last bear market. With greater access to capital, the company was able to invest at rock bottom prices, highlighting the company's capital advantage and savvy leadership.

Goldman Sachs also anticipates both EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK exchange rates to gradually decline toward the firm\u2019s three-month targets.The bank\u2019s outlook is tempered by potential risks, noting that both currencies, particularly NOK, could underperform significantly during periods of reduced risk appetite or continued U.S. economic slowdown. For the Norwegian krone, these cyclical risks are further complicated by Goldman\u2019s bearish outlook on oil prices in the coming months.Goldman Sachs identifies the Norwegian general election on September 8 as a key risk event for NOK. The firm highlights that the most significant currency impact could come from the success of parties advocating for looser restrictions on channeling foreign currency revenues from Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund back into NOK and the domestic economy.The Progress Party in Norway has been campaigning on this platform, which could create upside potential for the currency if successful. However, Goldman considers significant wealth fund reform a low-probability outcome, citing historical resistance to changing the fund\u2019s mandate and current polling that suggests no single party is likely to achieve a majority.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
