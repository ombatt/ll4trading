Both contracts settled at their highest since June 20.On Tuesday, Trump said he would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia \"10 days from today\" if Moscow did not make progress toward ending the war in Ukraine.\"We've amped it up. We have a hard deadline of 10 days,\" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group. \"And there's a suggestion that other countries are going to join us.\"Also on Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he had told Chinese officials that, given U.S. secondary tariff legislation on sanctioned Russian oil, China could face high tariffs if Beijing continued its Russian oil purchases.Bessent was speaking after two days of bilateral talks aimed at resolving longstanding economic disputes and stepping back from an escalating trade war between the world's two biggest economies.Also supporting oil prices, the trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union, while imposing a 15% import tariff on most EU goods, sidestepped a full-blown trade war between the two major allies that would have rippled across nearly a third of global trade and dimmed the outlook for fuel demand.\"There is definitely some optimism around the trade deals,\" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. \"It's not perfect, especially for the Europeans, but it is better than it could have been by a long shot.\"The agreement also calls for $750 billion of EU purchases of U.S. energy over the next three years, which analysts say the bloc has virtually no chance of meeting, while European companies are to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over Trump's term.In the U.S., crude stockpiles rose by 1.54 million barrels last week, market sources said, citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to release weekly inventory data on Wednesday.

He made the threat after saying that two days of U.S.-China trade talks in Stockholm had been very constructive.Bessent's comments followed a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump that the U.S. would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia \"ten days from today\" if Moscow did not make progress toward ending the war in Ukraine.The dollar advanced against the euro, which hit its lowest point since June 23 and was on track for its fourth straight day of losses as investors sobered up to the fact that the new U.S.-EU trade deal favoured the United States and did little for the 27-nation bloc's economic outlook.While monitoring trade updates, investors were also preparing for inflation and payroll reports as well as quarterly results from large companies such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Apple and Amazon.And as if this wasn't enough to worry about they are also waiting for the Fed's policy statement and commentary, due on Wednesday afternoon following the U.S. central bank's two-day meeting. The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates steady, pending more clarity on the impact of tariffs on inflation, even with constant demands from Trump for rate cuts.\"Trading is biased to the upside. But given that we have a barrage of information coming in over the next couple days, traders and investors are going to be a little bit hesitant,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.The S&P 500 registered record closing highs in the last six sessions. On Tuesday, the index breached 6,400 for the first time before pulling back due to \"a little bit of psychological hesitancy\" about moving past the big round number, Saglimbene said.The strategist also pointed to signs of pressure from tariffs in quarterly results. United Parcel Service reported quarterly profit marginally below estimates and did not issue annual revenue and margin forecasts. Procter & Gamble on Tuesday forecast annual results largely below estimates and said it would raise prices on some products in the U.S. to steer it through tariff uncertainty.", "analysis": 2}, "3": {"title": "Oil Prices Jump After Trump Ratchets Up Truce Pressure on Russia", "source": "Financial Post", "link": "https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/oil-holds-gain-as-trumps-russia-deadline-raises-supply-concerns", "date": "2025-07-29T03:34:57+00:00", "body": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Oil ended the session at the highest levels in over a month as President Donald Trump reiterated that the US may impose additional levies on Russia unless it reached a truce with Ukraine, stoking worries about tighter supplies.West Texas Intermediate oil settled at $69.21 a barrel while Brent settled above $72 a barrel, with both benchmarks at the highest since June.\u00a0Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday, Trump warned of the potential for secondary sanctions if Moscow fails to reach a ceasefire within ten days.

Across India, processors typically run plants at close to 100% of nameplate capacity, or over.\u00a0The lowered operations are due to mounting logistical issues and trading partners turning away from Nayara, making it difficult for the company to monetize and transport its refined output to customers.Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.This week, local shipowners are reassessing their dealings with Nayara, citing pressure from mutual-insurance groups known as P&I clubs, said two shipbrokers who specialize in fixing tankers for Indian routes. Many ships plying Indian coastal routes rely on P&I clubs that are based in the UK and across Europe, which comply with EU sanctions.\u00a0Ships found to be handling Nayara cargoes and trades could lose coverage from western P&I groups, which largely represents European insurers.Follow Bloomberg India on WhatsApp for exclusive content and analysis on what billionaires, businesses and markets are doing.

The tanker, owned by Mumbai-based Seven Islands Shipping and covered by UK-based NorthStandard P&I club, was meant to deliver diesel to Mangalore.\u00a0Shippers are monitoring the status of this vessel due to the sensitivities around its Nayara cargo and western P&I coverage. Seven Islands didn\u2019t immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\u201cWhile an Indian entity may themselves not be subject to EU sanctions, NorthStandard is subject to EU regulation and cannot provide insurance cover for trades that would cause the Club to become or be in breach of sanctions,\u201d a spokesperson for the P&I club said, without referring to the Bourbon or Seven Islands.NorthStandard also released a circular late Tuesday saying that all P&I clubs in the International Group \u2014 an association of clubs \u2014 of have issued similarly worded notices to members that coverage for trades that breach applicable EU sanctions should not be offered.The EU sanctioned Nayara on July 18, saying its profits support Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. Russian oil giant Rosneft PJSC owns 49.13% of Nayara, which accounts for nearly 8% of India\u2019s refining capacity and 7% of its retail-fuel network.\u00a0The refiner\u2019s ability to maintain operations in the wake of the sanctions hinges on fuel sales at home and abroad, and crude feedstock imports.

This is one of those stocks that doesn't make headlines like the flashy tech companies, but is quietly building something huge while most investors are looking for the next AI company. In this article I'll analyze ET in light of recent developments and give my investment decision.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with ET.ET has one of the biggest networks in America when it comes to energy. I'm talking about over 125,000 miles of pipeline that crosses more than 30 states. That shows that ET is a company that is essentially the American energy's circulatory system.The first thing I want to touch on is how their volumes are growing overall. Interstate natural gas volumes are increased by 3% in Q1 2025 and reached a new partnership record, while crude oil shipments are up 10%, NGL shipments are up 4% and NGL exports are up 5%. Those are some really big numbers and we can clearly see the huge amount of energy that's flowing through their system every day.Before starting the year ET announced that they made an investment decision for the Hugh Brinson Pipeline which is a $2.7 billion project. That project links the Dallas/Fort Worth area to the Permian Basin. They say that the first phase will be able to handle 1.5 billion cubic feet of water every day and will be fully operational by the end of 2026.These days any company I analyze has AI related to it. ET is no different. They said they will make their first business contract to send natural gas straight to a data center. They worked out an agreement with CloudBurst Data Centers to develop a building just for AI. The facility will produce roughly 1.2 gigawatts of power which is enough for 750,000 homes.Co-CEO Tom Long said ET got requests for potential connections from 62 power plants it doesn't currently serve in 13 states and 15 power plants it currently serves. It also received requests from more than 70 potential data centers in 12 states.

Sustained dollar gains are a mixed blessing for Wall Street stocks and for President Donald Trump's administration, as it sees dollar depreciation as an integral part of tackling trade deficits and boosting competitiveness.I\u2019ll review today\u2019s market news and then look at whether the dollar's considerable tariff risk premium may be dissipating as trade deals get done.* The dollar rebound comes as the Federal Reserve starts its two-day policy meeting, though with no change in rates expected this week as eyes drift to its September gathering instead. A big week for labor market data kicks off with the release of U.S. June job openings, and then we\u2019ll see June goods trade, which will figure into the week's second-quarter U.S. GDP report.* In the thick of the corporate earnings season - with four big tech megacaps reporting this week and the likes of UPS, Merck and Boeing out later today - Wall Street indexes eked out new records on Monday. U.S. futures were positive again ahead of Tuesday's bell, with European and Chinese stocks rebounding too and only Japan bucking the trend.* Treasury markets were steady after hefty debt auctions on Monday. The Treasury announced plans to borrow $1.007 trillion in the third quarter, largely in line with forecasts though likely frontloaded with bill sales. Details of the quarterly refunding will be released on Wednesday. Along with the Fed meeting, bonds kept a close eye on higher crude oil prices after Trump set a new deadline of \"10 or 12 days\" for Russia to make progress toward ending the war in Ukraine or face more sanctions on both Moscow and buyers of its oil exports.Today's Market Minute* U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators met for a second day of talks in Stockholm to defuse the bilateral trade war between the world's two biggest economies.

At the time of writing, WTI Crude was trading at $66.60 per barrel, down $0.06 or 0.09%, while Brent Crude hovered at $70.00, slipping just $0.04 or 0.06%.  Among the catalysts for Monday&rsquo;s rally&mdash;where Brent futures surged more than 2.3%&mdash;was President Trump&rsquo;s decision to drastically reduce the timeline for Russia to broker peace in Ukraine. Originally expected to be a 50-day negotiation window, the new deadline is now a mere 10&ndash;12 days, with potential for severe secondary sanctions should Moscow fail to act.  Analysts at ING note that if enforced, these measures could dramatically reshape the global oil landscape. Trump&rsquo;s warning includes 100% secondary tariffs on any country importing Russian crude. This would place heavy economic pressure on China, India, and Turkey, who have significantly increased Russian oil imports since the start of the war.  Whether or not these sanctions would be enforced remains unclear, with Trump&rsquo;s preference for lower oil prices having the potential to temper his appetite for measures that would ignite a spike. As ING points out, Russian oil exports exceed 7 million b/d, and any disruption would erase the projected market surplus through 2026.  While geopolitical risks are pushing supply-side pressure higher, demand fundamentals also found support in recent trade developments. Over the weekend, the U.S. and European Union signed a framework agreement that cut potential export tariffs from 30% to 15%, a move that significantly eased transatlantic trade tensions.  More importantly for energy markets, the deal includes a commitment by the EU to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy products over the coming years. This bolstered long-term demand expectations and helped underpin investor confidence.  Traders are also eyeing OPEC developments. A key panel meeting has called for full compliance with production quotas, ahead of the August 3 ministerial summit, which is expected to consider a potential supply boost for September. The current backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty may influence the group&rsquo;s willingness to raise output.  Meanwhile, caution prevails ahead of this week&rsquo;s Federal Reserve meeting, with the central bank widely expected to keep interest rates steady in the 4.25%&ndash;4.50% range. The Fed&rsquo;s tone on inflation and economic resilience could further shape oil demand expectations heading into August.

Russia is continuing the war and is also committed to resolving the conflict \u201cand to ensure our interests in the course of this settlement,\u201d he said.Trump threatened Monday to impose secondary sanctions within 10-12 days on countries buying Russian exports including energy unless Putin accepts a ceasefire, instead of the 50 days he announced earlier this month. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to wait. If you know what the answer is,\u201d he said.Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.The US president has voiced mounting frustration at Putin\u2019s refusal to agree to a truce in Ukraine to allow for peace talks, after he returned to the White House in January on a campaign pledge to swiftly end the war that\u2019s now in its fourth year. Six phone calls between the two leaders have produced little progress and intensifying Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine in recent weeks have added to US perceptions that Putin is intent on continuing the invasion.\u201cPutin isn\u2019t guided by what Trump expects from him and isn\u2019t afraid of new sanctions,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. \u201cPutin is convinced there\u2019s nothing left but a military conflict and it\u2019s necessary to double down on military efforts until Ukraine collapses and slowly begins to slide into the hands of Russia.\u201dAt the same time, there\u2019s skepticism in Moscow that Trump will make good on his threat, having repeatedly delayed action against Putin in the past. Ukraine and European leaders thought they had Trump\u2019s backing in May for an ultimatum demanding Putin accept an immediate ceasefire ahead of negotiations, only for the US leader to back away when Putin offered talks without a truce.\u00a0Trump in July declared he was preparing a \u201cmajor statement\u201d on Russia. That turned out to be his announcement of the 50-day deadline for Putin to agree to a ceasefire, something Moscow interpreted as a window allowing its military to intensify efforts to seize more territory in Ukraine at the height of the summer fighting season.While maintaining relations with Trump is important for Putin, the Russian leader \u201chas no desire to stop, and even more so under pressure,\u201d said Moscow-based political analyst Andrei Kolesnikov.Markets responded more nervously. The ruble continued to weaken on Tuesday, hovering around 82 per dollar in Moscow, after it declined by nearly 3% in the wake of Trump\u2019s remarks to the lowest since mid-May.Oil prices climbed, amid concerns over potential disruptions in Russian oil supplies or increased costs from rerouted flows. The Brent benchmark was trading above $70 a barrel following a 2.3% increase in the previous session, the biggest in two weeks.Russia is a top-three global oil producer after the US and Saudi Arabia, exporting more than 3 million barrels a day by sea alone, and supplies crude to such major consumers as India and China. Any significant disruptions in Russian flows in the near future would require a ramp-up in supplies from other major producers and rerouting of existing barrels, just as the global market remains tight amid robust summer demand.Peskov said there are no plans for a meeting between Putin and Trump. The US president told reporters in Scotland on Monday that he was \u201cnot so interested in talking any more\u201d to Putin because past conversations were followed by Russian attacks that killed people in Ukraine.Putin \u201choped there would be a normal conversation with Trump, where it would be possible to explain\u201d Russia\u2019s position, according to Stanovaya. Now he sees \u201cno alternative\u201d to continuing the invasion even as Russian society is tired of the war and the economy faces growing strains, she said.Russia\u2019s response \u201cto Trump\u2019s ultimatum will be the same as it has been to all ultimatums for the past 500 years,\u201d Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political consultant close to the Kremlin, said on Telegram. \u201cGet lost!

The Bass Strait production assets can cover 40% of demand on Australia&rsquo;s east coast.  The Bass Strait is the oldest Australian offshore oil and gas operation. Production there began in 1969, and since then, the deposit has yielded over 11 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and more than 5 billion barrels of crude oil in sales, according to Woodside Energy. Currently, the Bass Strait is the largest supplier of gas to the eastern states, including Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, and South Australia.

Trump's $750 Billion Energy Export Vow Has Failed Already  - One of the key tenets of the US-EU trade deal, namely that European countries would buy $750 billion of American energy over the next three years, would be close to impossible to achieve. - Europe's total energy imports from the US already totalled slightly south of $80 billion last year, after LNG deliveries ticked in at 36 million tonnes and crude oil supplies soared to a record 74.5 million tonnes. - Tripling current energy flows would be a Herculean task, with European refining demand handicapped by the closure of four plants in 2025 and regional gas consumption to increase by 1.5% from last year, equivalent to roughly 3 million metric tonnes of incremental LNG. - The pledge could be further watered down by the EU counting its investments into the US energy sector as part of the $750 billion, as well as Brussels counting new nuclear projects into it even if none of the small nuclear reactors would see daylight this decade.   Market Movers- Global mining giant Rio Tinto NYSERIO is reportedly considering the sale of its titanium unit due to weak prices and low returns, finding it hard to compete with mushrooming Chinese mines. - US LNG developer Venture Global NYSEVG announced that it had reached a final investment decision on the $15 billion Calcasieu Pass 2 project, aiming for peak capacity of 28 mtpa with first deliveries starting in 2027. - US power company Duke Energy NYSEDUK stated it would sell its Tennessee natural gas distribution business to regional utility firm Spire NYSESR for $2.5 billion in cash, seeking to unlock capital to invest in grid upgrades. - Thailand's national oil company PTT bought out the 50% ownership share of US oil major Chevron NYSECVX from the offshore A-18 block in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area for $450 million, taken over following its Hess acquisition.  Tuesday, July 29, 2025  Donald Trump continues to be the main newsmaker across the globe, shortening the deadline for Russia to make progress on its Ukraine ceasefire talks, threatening secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian energy. This was enough to lift ICE Brent futures above $70 per barrel, further buoyed by market optimism that US-China trade talks could bear fruition after Trump squeezed out a deal from the European Union.  OPEC Calls For Better Compliance.

In July, China is poised to export 859,000 barrels per day bpd of gasoline, diesel, and other light and middle distillates, up from 796,000 bpd in June, according to data by commodity analytics firm Kpler cited by Reuters columnist Clyde Russell.  The export volumes in July are set to be the highest since March 2024, as refining margins have increased in recent months. The refining margin for gasoil, the key component for making diesel, has jumped by more than 50% since March this year to above $20 per barrel at the end of July.  Gasoil exports from China are also on track for more than a year-high in July, per the data compiled by Kpler.  Chinese refiners are looking to capture higher margins this summer, following weak margins in the first quarter and part of the second quarter. The plants also have unused quotas for exports of fuels, which the central government allocates to refiners.  As fuel demand in China has largely disappointed bulls so far this year, the overseas market has started to look more tempting for refiners with quotas amid rising margins.  Improved fuel margins and the end of spring maintenance boosted China&rsquo;s oil refinery throughput in June to the highest level since September 2023.  Chinese refiners processed a total of 15.2 million bpd of crude oil into fuels last month, up by 8.5% from a year earlier, and up from the lows seen in April and May.  China may have room to raise distillate fuel exports further, especially those of diesel, as the market is set to tighten more than previously expected, due to new EU sanctions targeting imports of fuels processed from Russian crude oil.

Vitol is owned by its management and employees, with the number somewhere between 450 and 500 people.  The payout, according to Bloomberg, highlights the continued energy market disruption that has made a lot of money to a small group of commodity trading companies since 2022, the start of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions that tried to restrict Russian energy commodity exports and, to a certain extent, succeeded.  Per Bloomberg, Vitol has reaped the greatest benefits from the situation, booking a net profit of $8.7 billion for last year, which was more than the combined profits of its four biggest competitors, Gunvor, Mercuria, Trafigura, and Glencore.  Yet the amount of money that commodity giants are making is subsiding, Bloomberg also noted in its report. The global energy commodities markets are adapting to the new situation, and their profitability is declining, as evidenced by Vitol&rsquo;s payout for 2024, which exceeds its profit for the year, Bloomberg said.  Earlier this year, Vitol forecast that oil demand will remain at current levels over the next 15 years at least, shattering earlier predictions from outlets such as the International Energy Agency, which has consistently been saying oil demand growth will peak before 2030.  Demand for crude is set to rise further in the coming years, to peak at around 110 million barrels daily, the commodity giant said in its long-term report from February, adding that after it reaches that peak, it would begin declining, to reach the current level of daily average demand at 105 million bpd in 2040.

After surging more than 3% on Tuesday, both major crude benchmarks saw modest gains in early Asian trade. At the time of writing, WTI crude was up slightly at $69.24 per barrel, while Brent crude also edged higher to $72.66 per barrel, marking their highest levels since June 22.  The Tuesday rally was largely triggered by mounting pressure from the United States on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, with former President Donald Trump issuing a shortened 10-12 day ultimatum for Russia to show meaningful progress or face new secondary sanctions. These measures would include 100% tariffs on trading partners continuing to import Russian oil, a move that ING analysts said &ldquo;would lead to a dramatic shift in the oil market.&rdquo;  Such tariffs are expected to deter major importers like China and India. While China would be more likely to resist U.S. pressure, India has signaled its willingness to comply, potentially putting as much as 2.3 million barrels per day of Russian exports at risk.  Simultaneously, the United States and European Union managed to avert a full-blown trade war with a deal that introduced 15% U.S. tariffs on certain EU imports, relieving some concerns over global economic growth and offering oil prices additional support.  Meanwhile, in Venezuela, foreign oil partners are still waiting on U.S. approvals to resume sanctioned operations&mdash;a potential wildcard for global supply dynamics if those barrels re-enter the market.  The latest American Petroleum Institute API data also cast a shadow over the recent rally. According to the API, U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 1.5 million barrels in the week ending July 25, against expectations for a 2.5 million-barrel draw. This surprise build suggests demand softness or refining bottlenecks in the world&rsquo;s largest fuel consumer.  The market now awaits official inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later today, for confirmation.  Oil traders remain cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s interest rate decision later on Wednesday. While the Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady, the accompanying statement and economic projections could influence market sentiment and the U.S. dollar&mdash;an important factor for oil prices.  A stronger dollar, which gained ahead of the Fed decision, tends to put downward pressure on crude by making it more expensive for foreign buyers.  Other economic data due this week includes nonfarm payrolls on Friday, China&rsquo;s PMI numbers on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan&rsquo;s interest rate decision, all of which could influence global energy demand projections.  Oil prices are set for another volatile week with geopolitical and economic catalysts sure to shift sentiment several times in the coming days.

The company told investors earlier this month it's in advanced talks with potential buyers and expects to announce a sale later this year. Galp controls an 80% stake in Mopane and, according to Bloomberg, is preparing for a development that could involve two floating production storage and offloading FPSO units, each pumping around 120,000 barrels a day.  That's a meaningful step forward for a country that only started grabbing oil industry headlines in 2022. Located in Namibia's Orange Basin, the Mopane field sits in an increasingly crowded zone that has drawn aggressive exploration by Shell, TotalEnergies, Chevron, and others. Galp's early data suggests Mopane could hold at least 10 billion barrels of oilone of the largest deepwater discoveries in recent African history.  Meanwhile, TotalEnergies is moving forward with its Venus discovery, one of Namibia's other marquee projects. The French major plans to make a final investment decision in early 2026, with first oil targeted by 2029. The project will include a single FPSO capable of producing around 150,000 barrels a day. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told reporters the project is technically challenging but commercially viable, citing expected breakeven costs of just $20 per barrel, even in ultra-deep waters 3,000 meters below the surface.  The rush to develop offshore Namibia is partly driven by a global oil industry increasingly hungry for low-cost, scalable reserves. As onshore fields mature and geopolitical risks rise in traditional production zones, frontier deepwater finds like Mopane and Venus are receiving fresh attention. Namibia's pro-investment stance, favorable fiscal regime, and political stability have helped its rise as a credible energy prospect.  But technical and geological hurdles are starting to show. Namibia's subsurface is less favorable than Guyana's, with lower permeability rocks and a higher gas-to-oil ratio that complicates flow rates and requires costly gas re-injection. In January, Shell took a $400 million write-down on its Jonker-1 well in the Orange Basin, saying the find was unlikely to be commercialized. Chevron also came up dry in its Kapana 1-X well within Block 2813B, though the company said geological data collected was valuable for future targeting.  Total has also relinquished several offshore blocks, including 5/6/7, while retaining deepwater acreage it considers more prospective. These setbacks have caused investors to recalibrate expectations for the basin. \"I think the hype was too high, right, so we need to lower our expectations,\" Namibia's central bank Governor Johannes Gawaxab told Bloomberg.  Despite the challenges, momentum is building behind a handful of anchor projects. Shell's Graff and Jonker discoveries, Galp's Mopane, and TotalEnergies' Venus could collectively turn Namibia into a mid-tier oil producer by the mid-2030s. Industry analysts now forecast peak output between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day, which is less than Guyana's explosive trajectory but still a significant step up for a country that produced zero oil just three years ago.  Infrastructure will be key. Namibia lacks the deepwater pipelines, refineries, and port capacity of more established producers. Most operators are planning offshore FPSOs to sidestep onshore limitations, but those units will require financing, fabrication, and export solutions. Galp has not disclosed potential offtake partners, but industry watchers expect interest from Asian and European refiners looking to diversify away from Russian and Middle Eastern crude.  Financing is also top of mind. While majors like TotalEnergies and Shell can self-fund early-stage development, smaller players like Galp often rely on joint ventures, asset sales, or sovereign wealth funds to shoulder multibillion-dollar capex. Namibia's government has so far avoided demands for high state participation but is eyeing new royalty and tax revenues to boost domestic spending. According to Namibia's Petroleum Commissioner, the country could earn over $5 billion annually at peak production levels if key projects come online.  The broader hope is that oil development can deliver long-term economic transformation. Namibia has one of the highest unemployment rates in Africa and relies heavily on mining, tourism, and agriculture. Energy officials have stressed the need to avoid a resource curse and are reportedly working with development banks and Norwegian advisers to design revenue-sharing mechanisms and sovereign investment vehicles.  If Galp succeeds in closing a sale and Total moves ahead on schedule, Namibia could see its first barrels by 2027, barely five years after its deepwater potential became widely recognized. That's an aggressive timeline, but one that energy investors are watching closely. In an era of tightening supply and rising geopolitical risk, Namibia's deepwater riches could offer rare breathing room for a stretched global oil market.

The issue matures in 2030 and is denominated in dollars, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed source. It is also larger than initial plans, the report said, with initial plans being for up to $10 billion in debt finance.  The debt instrument that the government is using is called pre-capitalized notes, whose aim is to help strengthen the balance sheet of the company without saddling the government with direct guarantees for financial support, according to reports in the news. Even so, it has been registered as a red flag by at least one credit rater. Fitch wrote last month that Pemex&rsquo;s financial woes were affecting Mexico&rsquo;s sovereign rating negatively.  &ldquo;If Pemex were in a better situation and were not a source of contingent liabilities for sovereign debt, Mexico could have had a rating one level higher than the current one&rdquo;, Fitch&rsquo;s head of sovereign ratings for the Americas said, as quoted by Forbes.  Mexico&rsquo;s energy major is the most indebted company in the world, with a load of some $105 billion, of which some $20 billion in unpaid bills to suppliers. Refining output has stagnated, and issues with crude quality&mdash;including high water content&mdash;have alienated key buyers. Despite a 2024 cash infusion from the federal government, Pemex&rsquo;s working capital remains deeply negative.  In this context, the company&rsquo;s second-quarter financial report offered a rare glimpse of hope as it showed a rare profit, at $3.16 billion, following a loss of $2 billion for the first quarter of the year. The positive result was largely due to favorable exchange rates between the Mexican peso and the greenback. Meanwhile, sales during the quarter fell, and lower oil prices contributed to lower revenues.

After surging more than 3% on Tuesday, both major crude benchmarks saw modest gains in early Asian trade. At the time of writing, WTI crude was up slightly at $69.24 per barrel, while Brent crude also edged higher to $72.66 per barrel, marking their highest levels since June 22.  The Tuesday rally was largely triggered by mounting pressure from the United States on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, with former President Donald Trump issuing a shortened 10-12 day ultimatum for Russia to show meaningful progress or face new secondary sanctions. These measures would include 100% tariffs on trading partners continuing to import Russian oil, a move that ING analysts said &ldquo;would lead to a dramatic shift in the oil market.&rdquo;  Such tariffs are expected to deter major importers like China and India. While China would be more likely to resist U.S. pressure, India has signaled its willingness to comply, potentially putting as much as 2.3 million barrels per day of Russian exports at risk.  Simultaneously, the United States and European Union managed to avert a full-blown trade war with a deal that introduced 15% U.S. tariffs on certain EU imports, relieving some concerns over global economic growth and offering oil prices additional support.  Meanwhile, in Venezuela, foreign oil partners are still waiting on U.S. approvals to resume sanctioned operations&mdash;a potential wildcard for global supply dynamics if those barrels re-enter the market.  The latest American Petroleum Institute API data also cast a shadow over the recent rally. According to the API, U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 1.5 million barrels in the week ending July 25, against expectations for a 2.5 million-barrel draw. This surprise build suggests demand softness or refining bottlenecks in the world&rsquo;s largest fuel consumer.  The market now awaits official inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later today, for confirmation.  Oil traders remain cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s interest rate decision later on Wednesday. While the Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady, the accompanying statement and economic projections could influence market sentiment and the U.S. dollar&mdash;an important factor for oil prices.  A stronger dollar, which gained ahead of the Fed decision, tends to put downward pressure on crude by making it more expensive for foreign buyers.  Other economic data due this week includes nonfarm payrolls on Friday, China&rsquo;s PMI numbers on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan&rsquo;s interest rate decision, all of which could influence global energy demand projections.  Oil prices are set for another volatile week with geopolitical and economic catalysts sure to shift sentiment several times in the coming days.

The company told investors earlier this month it's in advanced talks with potential buyers and expects to announce a sale later this year. Galp controls an 80% stake in Mopane and, according to Bloomberg, is preparing for a development that could involve two floating production storage and offloading FPSO units, each pumping around 120,000 barrels a day.  That's a meaningful step forward for a country that only started grabbing oil industry headlines in 2022. Located in Namibia's Orange Basin, the Mopane field sits in an increasingly crowded zone that has drawn aggressive exploration by Shell, TotalEnergies, Chevron, and others. Galp's early data suggests Mopane could hold at least 10 billion barrels of oilone of the largest deepwater discoveries in recent African history.  Meanwhile, TotalEnergies is moving forward with its Venus discovery, one of Namibia's other marquee projects. The French major plans to make a final investment decision in early 2026, with first oil targeted by 2029. The project will include a single FPSO capable of producing around 150,000 barrels a day. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told reporters the project is technically challenging but commercially viable, citing expected breakeven costs of just $20 per barrel, even in ultra-deep waters 3,000 meters below the surface.  The rush to develop offshore Namibia is partly driven by a global oil industry increasingly hungry for low-cost, scalable reserves. As onshore fields mature and geopolitical risks rise in traditional production zones, frontier deepwater finds like Mopane and Venus are receiving fresh attention. Namibia's pro-investment stance, favorable fiscal regime, and political stability have helped its rise as a credible energy prospect.  But technical and geological hurdles are starting to show. Namibia's subsurface is less favorable than Guyana's, with lower permeability rocks and a higher gas-to-oil ratio that complicates flow rates and requires costly gas re-injection. In January, Shell took a $400 million write-down on its Jonker-1 well in the Orange Basin, saying the find was unlikely to be commercialized. Chevron also came up dry in its Kapana 1-X well within Block 2813B, though the company said geological data collected was valuable for future targeting.  Total has also relinquished several offshore blocks, including 5/6/7, while retaining deepwater acreage it considers more prospective. These setbacks have caused investors to recalibrate expectations for the basin. \"I think the hype was too high, right, so we need to lower our expectations,\" Namibia's central bank Governor Johannes Gawaxab told Bloomberg.  Despite the challenges, momentum is building behind a handful of anchor projects. Shell's Graff and Jonker discoveries, Galp's Mopane, and TotalEnergies' Venus could collectively turn Namibia into a mid-tier oil producer by the mid-2030s. Industry analysts now forecast peak output between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day, which is less than Guyana's explosive trajectory but still a significant step up for a country that produced zero oil just three years ago.  Infrastructure will be key. Namibia lacks the deepwater pipelines, refineries, and port capacity of more established producers. Most operators are planning offshore FPSOs to sidestep onshore limitations, but those units will require financing, fabrication, and export solutions. Galp has not disclosed potential offtake partners, but industry watchers expect interest from Asian and European refiners looking to diversify away from Russian and Middle Eastern crude.  Financing is also top of mind. While majors like TotalEnergies and Shell can self-fund early-stage development, smaller players like Galp often rely on joint ventures, asset sales, or sovereign wealth funds to shoulder multibillion-dollar capex. Namibia's government has so far avoided demands for high state participation but is eyeing new royalty and tax revenues to boost domestic spending. According to Namibia's Petroleum Commissioner, the country could earn over $5 billion annually at peak production levels if key projects come online.  The broader hope is that oil development can deliver long-term economic transformation. Namibia has one of the highest unemployment rates in Africa and relies heavily on mining, tourism, and agriculture. Energy officials have stressed the need to avoid a resource curse and are reportedly working with development banks and Norwegian advisers to design revenue-sharing mechanisms and sovereign investment vehicles.  If Galp succeeds in closing a sale and Total moves ahead on schedule, Namibia could see its first barrels by 2027, barely five years after its deepwater potential became widely recognized. That's an aggressive timeline, but one that energy investors are watching closely. In an era of tightening supply and rising geopolitical risk, Namibia's deepwater riches could offer rare breathing room for a stretched global oil market.

The issue matures in 2030 and is denominated in dollars, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed source. It is also larger than initial plans, the report said, with initial plans being for up to $10 billion in debt finance.  The debt instrument that the government is using is called pre-capitalized notes, whose aim is to help strengthen the balance sheet of the company without saddling the government with direct guarantees for financial support, according to reports in the news. Even so, it has been registered as a red flag by at least one credit rater. Fitch wrote last month that Pemex&rsquo;s financial woes were affecting Mexico&rsquo;s sovereign rating negatively.  &ldquo;If Pemex were in a better situation and were not a source of contingent liabilities for sovereign debt, Mexico could have had a rating one level higher than the current one&rdquo;, Fitch&rsquo;s head of sovereign ratings for the Americas said, as quoted by Forbes.  Mexico&rsquo;s energy major is the most indebted company in the world, with a load of some $105 billion, of which some $20 billion in unpaid bills to suppliers. Refining output has stagnated, and issues with crude quality&mdash;including high water content&mdash;have alienated key buyers. Despite a 2024 cash infusion from the federal government, Pemex&rsquo;s working capital remains deeply negative.  In this context, the company&rsquo;s second-quarter financial report offered a rare glimpse of hope as it showed a rare profit, at $3.16 billion, following a loss of $2 billion for the first quarter of the year. The positive result was largely due to favorable exchange rates between the Mexican peso and the greenback. Meanwhile, sales during the quarter fell, and lower oil prices contributed to lower revenues.

There is just one problem this number is laughably unrealistic because it would require the redirection of most US energy exports towards Europe and the EU has little control over the energy its companies import.  Indeed, as Rabobank explains, unless energy prices increase materially, that figure remains beyond realistic expectations. The EU imported roughly 65 billion worth of energy products from the U.S. in 2024, including 20 billion 35 million tons of U.S. LNG and 44 billion of oil and oil products. To reach the required $250 billion per year, the EU would need to import roughly 67% of its energy needs from the US, based on 2024 Eurostat data.  Even if the EU were to purchase all of its LNG from the U.S., the total would rise to only 4050 billion, based on 2024 prices. This would require countries like Russia, Algeria, Qatar, Nigeria, and even Norway to completely relinquish their market share in the EU, while the U.S. government would need to mandate its LNG exporters to prioritize Europe.  The shift in flows for crude oil and refined products would be even more substantial, as the EU currently imports only around 17% of its needs from the U.S. Existing suppliers in the Middle East and India are unlikely to surrender market share without significant economic incentives, while U.S. refining and export capacity is already stretched. Capacity, cost, and competition will continue to shape energy flows, regardless of political intent.  Reuters adds that \"there is strong competition for U.S. energy exports as other countries need the supplies - and have themselves pledged to buy more in trade deals. Japan agreed to a \"major expansion of U.S. energy exports\" in its U.S. trade deal last week, the White House said in a statement. South Korea has also indicated interest in investing and purchasing fuel from an Alaskan LNG project as it seeks a trade deal.\"  The flipside is just as laughable total U.S. energy exports to all buyers worldwide in 2024 amounted to $318 billion. Of that, the EU imported a combined $76 billion of U.S. petroleum, LNG and solid fuels such as coal in 2024, according to Reuters' calculations based on Eurostat data.  More than tripling those imports was unrealistic, analysts said.  Arturo Regalado, senior LNG analyst at Kpler, said the scope of the energy trade envisioned in the deal \"exceeds market realities.\"  \"U.S. oil flows would need to fully redirect towards the EU to reach the target, or the value of LNG imports from the US would need to increase sixfold,\" Regalado said.  Competition for U.S. energy could drive up benchmark US oil and gas prices and encourage U.S. producers to favour exports over domestic supply. That could make fuel and power costs more expensive, which would be a political and economic headache for U.S. and EU leaders.  Meanwhile, the EU estimates its member countries' plans to expand nuclear energy would require hundreds of billions of euros in investments by 2050. Its nuclear reactor-related imports, however, totalled just 53.3 billion euros in 2024, trade data shows.  The energy pledge reflected the EU's analysis of how much U.S. energy supply it could accommodate, a senior EU official told Reuters, but that would depend on investments in U.S. oil and LNG infrastructure, European import infrastructure, and shipping capacity.  \"These figures, again, are not taken out of thin air. So yes, they require investments,\" said the senior official, who declined to be named. \"Yes, it will vary according to the energy sources. But these are figures which are reachable.\"  There was no public commitment to the delivery, the official added, because the EU would not buy the energy - its companies would. Private companies import most of Europe's oil, while a mix of private and state-run companies import gas. The European Commission can aggregate demand for LNG to negotiate better terms, but cannot force companies to buy fuel. That is a commercial decision.  \"It's just unrealistic,\" ICIS analysts Andreas Schrder and Ajay Parmar said in written comments to Reuters. \"Either Europe pays a super high non-market reflective price for U.S. LNG or it takes way too much LNG volumes, more than it can cope with.\"  The United States is already the EU's top supplier of LNG and oil - thanks to the Biden-inspired war in Ukraine and the CIA blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline from Russia - shipping 44% of EU LNG needs and 15.4% of its oil in 2024, according to EU data. Raising imports to the target would require a U.S. LNG expansion way beyond what is planned through 2030, said Jacob Mandel, research lead at Aurora Energy Research.  \"You can add on capacity,\" Mandel said. \"But if you're talking about the scale that would be necessary to meet these targets, the $250 billion, then it's not really feasible.\" Europe could buy $50 billion more of U.S. LNG annually as supply increases, he said.  Amusingly, higher EU fuel purchases would, however, run counter to forecasts for EU demand to decline as it shifts to clean energy, analysts said.  \"There is no major need for the EU to import more oil from the U.S., in fact, its oil demand peaked a number of years ago,\" Schrder and Parmar said.

Lower rates reduce consumer borrowing costs and can boost economic growth and demand for oil.Brent crude futures rose $1.21, or 1.8%, to settle at $66.84 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $1.31, or 2.1%, to settle at $63.96.Those price gains pushed both crude benchmarks out of technically oversold territory for the first time in three days, and led Brent to its highest close since August 6.On Tuesday, Brent closed at its lowest price since June 5 and WTI closed at its lowest price since June 2 due in part to bearish inventory and supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency. [EIA/S]Trump said on Thursday he thought Putin was ready to make a deal on ending his war in Ukraine after the Russian president floated the prospect of a nuclear arms agreement on the eve of their summit in Alaska.But on Wednesday, Trump threatened \"severe consequences\" if Putin does not agree to peace in Ukraine, without elaborating. Trump has warned of economic sanctions if the meeting on Friday proves fruitless.Russia was the second-biggest producer of crude in 2024 behind the U.S., so any agreement that could ease sanctions on Moscow would likely boost the amount of Russian oil available for export to global markets.Trump has threatened to enact secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian crude, primarily China and India, if Russia continues its war in Ukraine.\"The uncertainty of U.S.-Russia peace talks continues to add a bullish risk premium given Russian oil buyers could face more economic pressure,\" Rystad Energy said in a client note.Some analysts, however, remained skeptical that Trump would take action that could significantly disrupt oil supplies.FED RATE CUTExpectations that the Fed will cut rates in September also propped up oil prices. Traders mostly believe a cut will happen next month after U.S. consumer prices increased at a moderate pace in July.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he thought an aggressive half-percentage-point cut was possible given recent weak employment numbers.But a jump in wholesale prices is likely to bolster concerns among Fed policymakers that rising inflation remains a risk, intensifying debate over the rationale for an rate cut next month and leaving the tension between the U.S. central bank and the White House unresolved.", "analysis": 2}, "87": {"title": "Oil price structure narrows, premiums fall as supplies rise, summer demand ends", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-price-structure-narrows-premiums-080426988.html", "date": "2025-08-14T08:04:26+00:00", "body": "By Florence Tan, Georgina McCartney and Robert HarveySINGAPORE/HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Premiums for prompt benchmark oil prices globally are falling compared with those in future months on rising output from the Middle East, Latin America and Europe, just as peak summer demand ends, traders and analysts said on Thursday.Easing concerns that the U.S. could impose more sanctions on Russia and further disrupt oil supplies are also weighing on oil prices, they said.The six-month time spreads for Brent futures (BZ=F), U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures (CL=F) and Middle East marker Dubai have narrowed by more than $1 a barrel in backwardation since the start of the month.Backwardation refers to a market structure where prompt prices are higher than those in future months, indicating tight supply.

He said there was a \"very good chance\" of a 50 basis point reduction in September and that rates should \"probably\" be 150-175 bps lower.* Wall Street zoomed to new records on Wednesday, but stock futures stepped back a touch ahead of the PPI report but two-year Treasury yields continued to stalk three-month lows. Even though many Fed officials are still cautious about the prospects for a half point cut, Wall Street banks are starting to forecast as many as three cuts this year, arguing softer jobs growth, a lack of \"pass-through\" from tariffs to consumer prices, and a new appointee to the Fed board will tip the balance.* Thursday's producer price update for July will be important as details feed into the Fed's favored PCE inflation gauge. Annual headline and core PPI inflation are expected to pick up to 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Meantime, President Donald Trump said his pick for the next Fed Chair would be named \"a little bit earlier\" and he'd narrowed it down three or four names, despite indications earlier on Wednesday that as many as a dozen names had been considered.* Elsewhere, the inflation picture softened further given this week's slide in crude oil prices to two-month lows ahead of the critical U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska tomorrow. Japan's yen jumped to three-week highs, knocking the Nikkei stock index back sharply from record highs, as Bessent also said the Bank of Japan was \"behind the curve\" in tackling inflation there. Sterling hit six-week highs on the euro after the release of above forecast UK GDP data. Finally, riffing off the week's heady surge in risk appetite and rate cut bets, Bitcoin jumped to a new record high at $124,481.Make sure to check out today's column, where I discuss why political pressure on government statisticians and private forecasters risks sending markets down a rabbit-hole.Today's Market Minute* U.S. President Donald Trump threatened \"severe consequences\" if Russia's Vladimir Putin does not agree to peace in Ukraine but also said on Wednesday that a meeting between them could swiftly be followed by a second that would include the leader of Ukraine.", "analysis": 1}, "97": {"title": "Chord Energy (OTCMKTS:WLLBW)  Shares Down 32.1%   \u2013 Time to Sell?", "source": "ETF Daily News", "link": "https://www.etfdailynews.com/2025/08/14/chord-energy-otcmktswllbw-shares-down-32-1-time-to-sell/", "date": "2025-08-14T07:27:04+00:00", "body": "Chord Energy Co.

The rise in supply from OPEC producers, as well as from Latin America and Europe, has eased the backwardation in the oil market in recent weeks, analysts and traders told Reuters on Thursday.  The backwardation structure in oil prices typically occurs when supply is tight, and in it, prices for front-month contracts are higher than the ones further out in time.  This summer, the market has been in backwardation  and still is  amid strong refinery runs globally and tighter markets for fuels, especially diesel in the United States. But the premiums of the prompt futures compared to later-dated contracts have been fallinga sign that traders expect the rise in supply to soon ease the market tightness once demand starts to weaken after the peak summer season.  \"Brent and Dubai time spreads are softening mainly on expectations of incremental OPEC supply from September and easing fears of Russian disruption after recent steady flows via both Baltic and Black Sea,\" Dubai-based oil trader Shohruh Zukhritdinov told Reuters.  With refinery runs set to decline after September, when OPEC will have added more production on the market, the supply tightness will ease.  Global crude runs will approach an all-time high of 85.6 million barrels per day bpd in August, with annual growth of 1.6 million bpd in the third quarter, well ahead of the first-half average increase of just 130,000 bpd, the International Energy Agency IEA said in its monthly report on Wednesday.  However, the consensus appears to be that come September and then the fourth quarter, demand will slow and rising supply will overwhelm the marketand the oil price structure has started to flash it.

According to a Financial Times report that cited an unnamed source, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund&rsquo;s investments in projects, including the smart city Neom, at the end of 2024 were worth the equivalent of $56 billion. This was down by 12.4% from the previous year, the report said.  &ldquo;There were impairments to certain projects primarily relating to global economic market conditions, changes to operational plans and increases in budgeted costs,&rdquo; the unnamed source told the Financial Times.  Last month, the media reported that the Saudi government was reassessing the scope and timeline of the $500-billion Neom project aimed at diversifying the Saudi economy away from crude oil. Per those reports, the reassessment was launched in response to deepening financial strain across the kingdom&rsquo;s Vision 2030 infrastructure program. The move comes amid mounting vendor arrears and a liquidity crunch that has prompted an urgent reallocation of energy-sector capital and personnel.  It is these megaprojects that make Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s breakeven oil price so high&mdash;quite a bit higher than current oil prices. Because of this price environment, economists earlier this year warned that the kingdom would have to reduce its spending plans by more than what Riyadh planned for this year, which was a 3.7% reduction in spending.  &ldquo;A sharper and sustained fall in the oil price would require a deeper retrenchment in government spending to contain the size of the shortfall and the building in government debt,&rdquo; Monica Malik, the chief economist of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, told the Financial Times at the time. &ldquo;There would also likely be some further adjustment and recalibration to the off-budget investment plans,&rdquo; she added.

Now, shale drillers are signaling there is still space to grow, so those expecting a decline after the peak will have to wait a bit longer.  \"We believe we are at a tipping point for U.S. oil production at current commodity prices,\" said Travis Stice, chief executive of Diamondback Energy back in May in a letter to shareholders. \"The amount of capital required to get back to 13 million barrels a day or 6 million barrels a day in the Permian might be an untenable lift for the business model that we put in place,\" Stice elaborated.  Now, the new chief executive of Diamondback is signaling this may not be the case. In comments on the company's performance, Kaes Van't Hof said that Diamondback was \"pushing the limits of efficiency\", drilling new wells faster and cheaper, Bloomberg's Javier Blas reported in his latest column, arguing rumors of shale's peak were greatly exaggerated.  Indeed, earlier in the year, the Energy Information Administration reported estimates that total U.S. oil production would decline from 13.5 million barrels daily in the first half of 2025 to 13.3 million barrels daily by the end of next year. Drilling activity was slowing down faster than expected, the EIA said, citing rig count data. Prices were weighing on drillers, prompting revisions of new well drilling plans.  Yet just last month, the EIA had to revise its own forecastbecause real-world data about oil production for May showed that shale drillers had kept expanding their production despite weaker international oil prices and despite a lower rig count. Granted, the growth was not bombastic, at 0.2% from the previous month, but on an annual basis, U.S. oil production gained 2.2% in May.  That, however, may not last very long. It normally takes several months before shale drillers respond to price weakness by curbing activity, and this year is no exception. Unless, that is, the demand outlook changes.  For much of this year, like last year, oil market commentary has focused on predictions of oversupply with a few sharp price swings following geopolitical events, suggesting that oversupply may be in jeopardy. Then there have been signs that there is no oversupply. The oil market is relatively balanced, and the chances of that balance tipping into the shortage direction are not insignificant, as some analysts noted after Trump's latest tariff threat to India for its buying of Russian crude.  A slowdown in the energy transition is not helping reinforce the bearish sentiment. In fact, the transition has slowed so much that Wood Mackenzie has warned the world may find itself in urgent need of additional oil barrels. From 2035 onwards, the energy consultancy said recently, global oil demand might require an additional 5% more oil annually than previously estimated, due to the slower-than-planned transition. By 2050, we would need an extra 100 billion barrels of both oil and gas to balance supply with demand.  There is much talk about accelerating the transition, but the actual pace of switching oil and gas for wind and solar remains slowwhich means there is a significant chance that the slowdown in U.S. shale is reversible as well. The moment prices tick up and stay up long enough, drillers will get their appetite for drilling back.  This is not to say there are no challenges that will be tricky to overcome. For starters, some in the oilfield services industry are warning that they have reached the limit for efficiency gains. \"We've tripled oil production in the last 15 years, and we have doubled natural gas production.\" But \"there's not a lot of gas left in the tank,\" the chief executive of Quantum Energy Partners, Wil VanLoh, told Bloomberg back in September. \"The US shale revolution has run its course.\"  The limit of efficiency gains means there is no more space to lower costs by adding efficiency to drilling, which would make drillers more sensitive to prices. In other bad news for shale oil production growth, the Texas Railroad Commission has warned the industry that the amount of fracking fluid they were using was creating problems with ground pressure. For this reason, the commission earlier this year said it would restrict the number of new wastewater disposal licenses it issues to drillers.  Indeed, part of the efficiency gains the shale industry has developed over the past decade or so includes a significant increase in the amount of fracking fluid used. Per Enverus, it has gone up seven times over 15 years. And now it has to be moderated to avoid bigger problems.  All this limits the growth potential for shale deposits, for sure. But it does not cancel it altogether. Indeed, peak shale may get delayed yet.

Despite the increase, China's oil product exports last month were also up from a year ago, suggesting lower domestic fuel demand.Forecasts of a growing oil market surplus also weighed on sentiment, as did the prospect of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates.Oil rig count, an indicator of future supply, rose by one to 412 this week, Baker Hughes data showed.Bank of America analysts said on Thursday that they were widening their forecast for the oil market surplus, citing growing supplies from the OPEC+ producer group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allies.The analysts now project an average surplus of 890,000 barrels per day from July 2025 through June 2026.", "analysis": 2}, "125": {"title": "Factbox-Russian energy facilities targeted in drone attacks", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/factbox-russian-energy-facilities-targeted-093424040.html", "date": "2025-08-15T09:34:24+00:00", "body": "(Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, with energy markets watching closely for...", "analysis": 1}, "126": {"title": "Oil and fuel prices hang in the balance as Trump and Putin meet to broker peace", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-fuel-prices-hang-balance-090000229.html", "date": "2025-08-15T09:00:00+00:00", "body": "Much will be on the line in geopolitics when President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet Friday in Alaska, in hope of brokering a peace accord in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

Peace means lower fuel prices for consumers, even as a bearish oil sector turns increasingly pessimistic about the months and year ahead. On the other hand: Hardening stances and increased sanctions against Russia and buyers of Russian oil would add pain at the pump, while potentially reinvigorating a languishing oil industry and driving higher revenues, analysts said.Regardless of the direction, incremental pricing swings are expected\u2014and not any dramatic boom or bust. Russia can only add so much oil to the global marketplace if sanctions are removed. The problem for the already slowed oil sector is that even smaller downward pricing changes can exacerbate the industry\u2019s struggles, given that OPEC has notably hiked its production volumes this year.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big wall of oil coming from Russia if peace breaks out,\u201d said energy forecaster Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer for Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm. \u201cMy expectation is there\u2019s a more significant impact on sentiment\u2014\u2018Here come the Russians\u2019\u2014than there would be on actual barrels.\u201dRussia produced 9.05 million barrels per day of crude oil in the second quarter of 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and analysts expect Russia could add back maybe 200,000 barrels daily in the short-to-medium term.

In a bearish market, every supply-related data point gets a little more weight than it probably should,\u201d Pickering said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bigger risk to sentiment than to the actual supply of oil.\u201dThe main reason: Western sanctions on Russian oil haven\u2019t been all that effective since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. China, India, and other buyers simply imported much more Russian oil, utilizing the so-called dark fleet of oil tankers that uses deceptive tactics to conceal what they\u2019re shipping.Still, Russian volumes have dipped from an estimated 9.2 million barrels daily in 2024 and from 9.6 million barrels in 2023, according to the DOE.", "analysis": 2}, "127": {"title": "What a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal could mean for global markets", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russias-war-ukraine-shaped-global-083317673.html", "date": "2025-08-15T08:33:17+00:00", "body": "LONDON (Reuters) -World markets are watching closely as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin meet in Alaska later on Friday to seal a possible ceasefire agreement in Ukraine.This is a conflict that sparked an energy shock, sent food prices soaring, battered European assets and cut Russia's economy off from much of the Western world.Details and the longevity of any agreement will be key, and for now investors are on standby.

Brent crude rose as much as 30% to $139 a barrel, while natural gas prices soared nearly 300% to record highs.Crude subsided in the following months. But Dutch TTF futures, the regional benchmark for natural gas, soared as Europe scrambled for an alternative to the Russian gas that fed over 40% of total demand.Europe has since become increasingly reliant on U.S. super-chilled liquefied natural gas.

The deal is part of a recent streak of U.S. oil purchases following President Trump&rsquo;s threat to impose additional tariffs on Indian exporters to the United States if the country continues buying Russian crude.  The October deal was priced at a premium of between $2.80 and $2.90 to dated Brent, Reuters&rsquo; sources said.  It is price that pushed India to step up Russian oil purchases in the first place, turning Russia from a minor exporter to the subcontinent, into one of its top crude oil suppliers, accounting for about a third of total imports.  India&rsquo;s government reacted negatively to Trump&rsquo;s threat, saying it had no intention of suspending oil imports from Russia, noting that the United States and the European Union were still buying energy commodities from Russia despite a barrage of energy sanctions on the latter.  Yet reports have been coming in about a pivot to U.S. oil as well as oil from other regions. Earlier this month, Indian Oil Corp. bought 2 million barrels of U.S. Mars crude, another 2 million barrels of Brazilian oil, and 1 million barrels of Libyan crude, Reuters sources said last week. These deals follow the securing of 8 million barrels by Indian Oil Corp. from sellers in the Middle East, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria.  Meanwhile, however, Tankers loaded with Russian crude that had stayed idle off India&rsquo;s coast for days discharged their cargo at Indian oil import terminals earlier this month, in defiance of the U.S. threats, Bloomberg reported, with the total discharged at 3 million barrels of Russian Urals, the flagship grade that Russia exports to Asia.  Shunning Russian oil entirely would add an estimated $20 billion to India&rsquo;s oil import bill over a period of two years, according to analyst calculations.

The deepwater exploration mission will add to another mission, the National Critical Minerals Mission, to secure resources essential for energy, industry, and defense.

Unlike the situation during the first meeting between Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin earlier in the year, Trump has adopted a far less conciliatory tone ahead of their second meeting in Alaska on August 15th, warning that Russia will face \"very severe consequences\" unless Putin agrees to end the war in Ukraine. However, the White House says it expects the Anchorage summit to be a \"listening exercise,\" downplaying the odds of a peace deal being reached.  Still, the potential of a return of more Russian energy commodities to the markets has depressed oil and gas prices amid expectations that a breakthrough in the negotiations could see sanctions on Russian exports lifted. Brent crude has pulled back from a 2-month high of $72.47 per barrel recorded two weeks ago to $66.72 per barrel in Thursday's intraday session, while WTI crude has declined from $70.00 per barrel to $63.81. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that fears that oil prices will crash if Trump manages to negotiate a truce with Putin are overdone. First off, StanChart says that Russia has been producing unsustainably at its maximum capacity with long-term consequences for its reservoirs. The country's oil production averaged 9.01 million barrels per day mb/d in H1-2025, about 610,000 b/d lower than the 2021 annual average before the invasion of Ukraine. A lifting of export sanctions will mean a return of Western service companies and Russia being able to access quality replacement parts; however, Russia just doesn't have a lot of spare production capacity to flood the oil markets.  Related How Canada's Oil Sands Producers Pump More Crude from the Same Assets  Second, Russia might demand the removal of the oil price cap by Western nations as part of the peace deal. However, the analysts have pointed out that the removal of the price cap would eliminate the price advantage for India and China to take Russian crude, currently the biggest buyers of discounted Russian oil. StanChart points out that India has been an opportunistic purchaser of cheaper Russian crude, and could revert to its previous import volumes with dire consequences for Russia. Previously, we reported that India imported goods worth $65.7 billion from Russia in 2024, a sharp rise from $8.25 billion in 2021. India's imports of Russian crude have increased more than 20-fold since the war began, jumping to $52.2 billion in 2024 from just $2.31 billion four years ago. Given the additional efforts Russia has undertaken to evade export sanctions, StanChart has predicted that we are unlikely to see a large increase in Russian supply to the global markets in the near term. JP Morgan echoes StanChart's view, saying that Russia has limited scope to expand its shadow fleet of tankers used to transport its crude.  Finally, Russia might not dramatically increase its crude exports for the simple reason that there might not be a ready market for the commodity. After all, Europe has successfully cut its dependency on Russian oil and gas over the past three years, and the continent is highly unlikely to put itself in such a vulnerable position again, especially after Moscow revealed its willingness to weaponize its energy commodities. In the final analysis, StanChart says that although the market might react to positive ceasefire news by selling off in the near term, this would be sentiment- rather than fundamentally-driven, and any price-dip on headlines would likely be short-lived.  When it comes to natural gas, StanChart notes that market expectations of higher Russian flows have been a key factor capping European gas prices in recent times. European natural gas futures have declined to a 2-week low of 32.5/MWh amid robust supply and easing geopolitical risk. While a ceasefire agreement and the associated removal of sanctions by the U..S and EU could potentially allow more Russian gas into Europe, StanChart expects appetite for Russian gas to be limited given the past weaponization of flows. The commodity experts say that a more likely development would be the return of small flows via Ukraine into Hungary and Slovakia. Finally, StanChart says that it's highly unlikely that the Trump administration would agree to a deal that would disrupt its own LNG sector, with U.S. LNG having largely replaced Russian pipeline gas to Europe.

The fall was less steep than in May and June, however, as reduced supply helped lift margins. Still, output over the first seven months has fallen 3.1% from last year to its weakest level since 2020.Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.Coal output fell 3.8% to just over 380 million tons, marking its first year-on-year decline in over a year, although production for the first seven months was still at record levels.While industrial demand for commodities is in a seasonal lull, the weather was also a factor in lowering production, as scorching temperatures and heavy rains forced mines, factories and building sites to curtail activity up and down the country. The coal hubs of northern China, in particular, were heavily affected by downpours that closed pits and disrupted transport.\u00a0The coal industry is also contending with government inspections targeting mines that produce above permitted levels. Meanwhile, pollution curbs to ensure blue skies for next month\u2019s military parade in Beijing are likely to keep the pressure on steel output, a large proportion of which is clustered around the capital.Thermal coal producers are shielded from swingeing cuts to production due to the country\u2019s reliance on the fuel for power generation, which has spiked over the summer as temperatures have soared. But the steel industry \u2014 and the miners that deliver coking coal for its blast furnaces \u2014 have much less protection.Property Collapse\u00a0The collapse in China\u2019s property market has stripped back a key pillar of demand. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that excess steel capacity last year was 142 million tons, almost four times the level in 2020.

Crude oil prices experienced an unprecedented plunge, falling to a negative $36.98 per barrel on April 20, 2020. However, the rapid development and rollout of vaccines facilitated the gradual reopening of economies, leading to a remarkable recovery in the pricing of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, which soared to $123.64 per barrel by March 8, 2022. Oil price data are from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.This highlights the inherent exposure of most energy companies to extreme volatility in commodity prices. However, unlike most energy companies,\u00a0Kinder Morgan, Inc.\u00a0KMI,\u00a0MPLX LP\u00a0MPLX and\u00a0The Williams Companies, Inc.\u00a0WMB are not highly vulnerable to commodity prices.Although the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in the midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices than oil and gas producers. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Hence, their business model is relatively low-risk, which indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.Kinder Morgan:\u00a0With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 79,000 miles, KMI is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America. It derives most of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts, generating stable fee-based revenues.The midstream energy major is likely to grow on the back of its business model, which is relatively resilient to volume and commodity price risks.MPLX:\u00a0MPLX\u2019s midstream business comprises transporting crude oil and refined products.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia expects the talks to bring results, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.\"President Trump will likely threaten further tariff pressure on India and possibly China as far as oil imports from Russia if the meeting stalemates, which is keeping a nervous trade to crude,\" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.\"If a ceasefire announcement is made, it will be taken as a negative to crude near-term,\" Kissler added.For the week, WTI dropped 1.7%, while Brent eased 1.1%.Weaker economic data from China, meanwhile, raised concerns over fuel demand.Chinese government data showed factory output growth slumped to an eight-month low and retail sales growth expanded at its slowest pace since December, weighing on sentiment despite stronger oil throughput in the world's second-largest crude user.Throughput at Chinese refineries rose 8.9% year-on-year in July, but that was down from June levels, which were the highest since September 2023. Despite the increase, China's oil product exports last month were also up from a year ago, suggesting lower domestic fuel demand.Forecasts of a growing oil market surplus also weighed on sentiment, as did the prospect of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates.Oil rig count, an indicator of future supply, rose by one to 412 this week, Baker Hughes data showed.Bank of America analysts said on Thursday that they were widening their forecast for the oil market surplus, citing growing supplies from the OPEC+ producer group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allies.The analysts now project an average surplus of 890,000 barrels per day from July 2025 through June 2026.", "analysis": 2}, "172": {"title": "Factbox-Russian energy facilities targeted in drone attacks", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/factbox-russian-energy-facilities-targeted-093424040.html", "date": "2025-08-15T09:34:24+00:00", "body": "(Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, with energy markets watching closely for...", "analysis": 1}, "173": {"title": "Oil and fuel prices hang in the balance as Trump and Putin meet to broker peace", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-fuel-prices-hang-balance-090000229.html", "date": "2025-08-15T09:00:00+00:00", "body": "Much will be on the line in geopolitics when President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet Friday in Alaska, in hope of brokering a peace accord in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. But there will be additional stakes for many business leaders\u2014because prices at the pump and the health of the oil industry are likely to swing depending on the talks\u2019 results.Whatever the outcome, it\u2019ll create winners and losers in the energy space. Peace means lower fuel prices for consumers, even as a bearish oil sector turns increasingly pessimistic about the months and year ahead. On the other hand: Hardening stances and increased sanctions against Russia and buyers of Russian oil would add pain at the pump, while potentially reinvigorating a languishing oil industry and driving higher revenues, analysts said.Regardless of the direction, incremental pricing swings are expected\u2014and not any dramatic boom or bust. Russia can only add so much oil to the global marketplace if sanctions are removed. The problem for the already slowed oil sector is that even smaller downward pricing changes can exacerbate the industry\u2019s struggles, given that OPEC has notably hiked its production volumes this year.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big wall of oil coming from Russia if peace breaks out,\u201d said energy forecaster Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer for Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm. \u201cMy expectation is there\u2019s a more significant impact on sentiment\u2014\u2018Here come the Russians\u2019\u2014than there would be on actual barrels.\u201dRussia produced 9.05 million barrels per day of crude oil in the second quarter of 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and analysts expect Russia could add back maybe 200,000 barrels daily in the short-to-medium term. That would represent a marked uptick, but not enough to truly upend oil markets.\u201cIn a bullish market, the market probably shrugs it off. In a bearish market, every supply-related data point gets a little more weight than it probably should,\u201d Pickering said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bigger risk to sentiment than to the actual supply of oil.\u201dThe main reason: Western sanctions on Russian oil haven\u2019t been all that effective since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. China, India, and other buyers simply imported much more Russian oil, utilizing the so-called dark fleet of oil tankers that uses deceptive tactics to conceal what they\u2019re shipping.Still, Russian volumes have dipped from an estimated 9.2 million barrels daily in 2024 and from 9.6 million barrels in 2023, according to the DOE.", "analysis": 2}, "174": {"title": "What a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal could mean for global markets", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russias-war-ukraine-shaped-global-083317673.html", "date": "2025-08-15T08:33:17+00:00", "body": "LONDON (Reuters) -World markets are watching closely as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin meet in Alaska later on Friday to seal a possible ceasefire agreement in Ukraine.This is a conflict that sparked an energy shock, sent food prices soaring, battered European assets and cut Russia's economy off from much of the Western world.Details and the longevity of any agreement will be key, and for now investors are on standby. Ukraine's government bonds - key indicators of the mood - in recent days have largely stalled at a still-distressed 55 cents on the dollar.\"The big issue will be, of course, that even if we get a ceasefire, how sustainable is that?\" said Zurich Insurance Group's chief markets strategist Guy Miller.Here is a summary of how Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two has shaped markets and what impact a ceasefire agreement could have.1/ EUROPE HURTEurope's reliance on cheap Russian gas meant its economy and stock market were ill-equipped to handle surging energy prices, and Germany's economy, Europe's industrial powerhouse, stagnated.Stocks were broadly punished, with sectors reliant on low energy prices, such as industrials and chemicals, notably hit.European banks also took a drubbing but have since recovered as those exposed to Russia cut ties.It has not been all doom and gloom and the European STOXX 600 index is not far off March's record high.Aerospace and defence stocks have had a supercharged rally since February 2022, with gains ranging from over 600% for Leonardo to over 1,500% for Rheinmetall.\"If the fighting stops in Ukraine, I'd expect defence stocks to come off a little bit but I think the fundamental reason why defence stocks have rallied is still there,\" said Toni Meadows, CIO at BRI Wealth Management.\"If Putin is still there and Trump is still there, then the need for Europe to spend on defence is still there.\"2/ HEATEDThe invasion triggered a surge in European energy prices. Brent crude rose as much as 30% to $139 a barrel, while natural gas prices soared nearly 300% to record highs.Crude subsided in the following months. But Dutch TTF futures, the regional benchmark for natural gas, soared as Europe scrambled for an alternative to the Russian gas that fed over 40% of total demand.Europe has since become increasingly reliant on U.S. super-chilled liquefied natural gas. The European Union has committed to boosting its purchases of U.S. crude, gas and coal from around $75 billion in 2024 to $250 billion per year to 2027, under a new U.S. trade deal - a figure most experts say is unrealistic.", "analysis": 2}, "175": {"title": "Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co.

The deal is part of a recent streak of U.S. oil purchases following President Trump&rsquo;s threat to impose additional tariffs on Indian exporters to the United States if the country continues buying Russian crude.  The October deal was priced at a premium of between $2.80 and $2.90 to dated Brent, Reuters&rsquo; sources said.  It is price that pushed India to step up Russian oil purchases in the first place, turning Russia from a minor exporter to the subcontinent, into one of its top crude oil suppliers, accounting for about a third of total imports.  India&rsquo;s government reacted negatively to Trump&rsquo;s threat, saying it had no intention of suspending oil imports from Russia, noting that the United States and the European Union were still buying energy commodities from Russia despite a barrage of energy sanctions on the latter.  Yet reports have been coming in about a pivot to U.S. oil as well as oil from other regions. Earlier this month, Indian Oil Corp. bought 2 million barrels of U.S. Mars crude, another 2 million barrels of Brazilian oil, and 1 million barrels of Libyan crude, Reuters sources said last week. These deals follow the securing of 8 million barrels by Indian Oil Corp. from sellers in the Middle East, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria.  Meanwhile, however, Tankers loaded with Russian crude that had stayed idle off India&rsquo;s coast for days discharged their cargo at Indian oil import terminals earlier this month, in defiance of the U.S. threats, Bloomberg reported, with the total discharged at 3 million barrels of Russian Urals, the flagship grade that Russia exports to Asia.  Shunning Russian oil entirely would add an estimated $20 billion to India&rsquo;s oil import bill over a period of two years, according to analyst calculations.

As of 937 a.m. EST on Friday, the U.S. benchmark oil price, WTI Crude, was down by 1.38% at $63.10, as President Trump departed for Anchorage, Alaska, to meet with Putin.  The international benchmark, Brent Crude, traded 1.18% lower at $66.07 per barrel.  The face-to-face meeting between President Trump and Putin is expected to begin around 3 p.m. EST and it's unclear how long it would take.  President Trump on Thursday threatened \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire agreement.  The market struggles to anticipate what the outcome of the Trump-Putin meeting will be. Some analysts are concerned that President Trump could agree to Russian terms that could include territorial concession by Ukraine.  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that decisions about Ukraine taken in his absence would be meaningless.  Trump has signaled he would at a later stage work for a meeting that would include Zelenskyy.  According to A/S Global Risk Management's chief analyst Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, the Friday meeting \"is unlikely to deliver significant results.\"  \"If a follow-up meeting is agreed, Trump may seek to place responsibility on Putin and Zelenskiy,\" Rasmussen told Bloomberg.  \"In the near term, new US sanctions are unlikely; a relaxation cannot be ruled out unless the meeting collapses,\" the analyst added.  A relaxation of the U.S. sanctions against Russia could increase concerns about oversupply on the market later this year and early 2026.  \"The geopolitical risk premium tied to the TrumpPutin meeting in Alaska is now a secondary driver, and unless talks break down sharply, the macro drag from the demand outlook may keep a lid on rallies, with Brent potentially struggling above USD 70 per barrel,\" Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a Friday note.

The week was shaped by several high-impact fundamental eventsnone of which proved decisive enough to shift the balance away from oversupply and tepid demand. Traders were focused on Friday's Trump-Putin meeting, but until concrete action disrupts physical flows, the dominant pressure remains rooted in inventories and production.  Trump-Putin Meeting Raises Risk, But Market Demands Proof  The most closely watched event of the week is Friday's planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Trump has threatened \"severe consequences\" should Putin fail to pursue peace in Ukraine, including potential secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian crudeparticularly China and India.  India alone sourced roughly 1.8 million barrels per day from Russia in the first half of the year, amounting to 37% of its total crude imports. Targeting these flows would represent a major shift in global balances, particularly for medium sour grades.  However, the market has shown skepticism. Traders remain unconvinced that Trump will follow through, given past patterns of backing away from aggressive rhetoric. Without formal sanctions or actual export disruptions, the geopolitical risk is being treated as a background factornot a directional force.  IEA and EIA Reports Add to Bearish Pressure  The supply-demand imbalance was reinforced this week by bearish signals from both the International Energy Agency IEA and the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA. The IEA raised its global supply forecast, citing stronger-than-expected output from OPEC and non-OPEC producers. Simultaneously, it trimmed its demand estimate due to persistent weakness in major economies, especially in Europe and Asia.  The EIA's weekly report showed a surprise 3 million barrel build in U.S. crude inventories, compared to expectations for a modest draw. Commercial crude stocks rose to 426.7 million barrels, while net imports surged by nearly 700,000 barrels per day. U.S. exports, meanwhile, declinedreflecting soft global demand for American crude.  Product data was mixed, with gasoline drawing down slightly and distillates increasing. Overall, the figures point to a market that is oversupplied and underdrawn, particularly given that refinery runs remain elevated and seasonal demand is near its peak. The lack of any tightening trend is weighing on sentiment.  Tariff Pause Provides Short-Term Relief but No Resolution  President Trump's decision to delay new tariffs on Chinese goods until November 10 provided temporary relief to global markets. Traders had been bracing for another escalation in trade restrictions, which could have hurt industrial activity and transportation fuel demand.  While the pause has removed immediate downside risk tied to trade policy, it does not suggest an agreement is near. The move was interpreted more as a political calculation than an economic strategy. For crude markets, this means that any demand boost is likely to be modest and temporary unless broader trade flows improve.  Rate Cut Expectations Help But Don't Reverse the Trend  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates in September, following weak U.S. employment data and a moderate inflation reading in July. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added to that speculation by suggesting a 50 basis point move could be warranted. But Thursday's hotter-than-expected PPI data, has taken the \"big\" cut off the table.  Rate cuts typically support crude demand by lowering borrowing costs, stimulating consumption, and weakening the dollar. While this has added a marginal boost to sentiment, the physical crude market remains weighed down by oversupply. Unless easier financial conditions translate into sustained product draws or stronger refinery runs, the impact on pricing will be limited.  OPEC Holds Steady While Non-OPEC Supply Grows  OPEC showed no sign of making new output adjustments this week, as members wait to see how global balances evolve. UBS revised its year-end Brent forecast downward to $62, citing resilient sanctioned exports and growing South American supply.  Guyana, in particular, continues to ramp up faster than expected. An Exxon-led consortium began production at a new offshore vessel four months ahead of schedule, adding barrels to an already saturated market. These barrels are increasingly finding buyers in the Atlantic Basin and adding pressure to traditional West African and Middle Eastern flows.  Saudi Arabia announced a cut in crude exports to China for September, lowering volumes to 1.43 million barrels per day from August's 1.65 million. However, the move coincided with higher official selling prices, which has reduced interest from major Asian refiners. Indian refiners received full Saudi allocations but did not request additional barrelssuggesting demand caution rather than supply constraint.  Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures    Trend Indicator Analysis  The main trend is down, according to the weekly swing chart. This week's trade through $62.69 changed the trend. Taking out $70.51 will change the main trend to up.  The market also crossed to the bearish side of the 52-week moving average at $64.25, which is a sign of weakness. Crude oil is also edging on the weak side of a pair of 50% levels at $64.13 and $65.37, indicating increasing downside pressure.  Weekly Technical Forecast  The direction of the Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures market the week ending August 22 is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $64.25.  Bullish Scenario  A sustained move over $64.25 will signal the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum, we could see a near-term rally through the long-term pivot at $65.37 with all eyes on a return to the swing top at $70.51.  Bearish Scenario  A sustained move under $64.25 will indicate the presence of sellers. This could lead to a quick test of the June low at $62.69. This price is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the downside with $52.00 to $51.00 the next potential targets.  Market Outlook Bearish Bias Unless Supply Disruption Emerges  While this week has introduced event risk from the Trump-Putin summit and central bank speculation, neither has changed the fundamental backdrop. Crude oil markets are well-supplied, global demand remains soft, and inventories are not drawing at a pace consistent with a bullish rebalancing.  Unless the U.S. enacts sanctions that materially reduce Russian exports, or unless next week's EIA data reveals a significant draw, crude is likely to remain under pressure. Traders are watching for signs of tighter physical balances, but so far, the signals continue to point lower.  The most probable outcome is continued range trading with a downward bias. Risk events remain in focus, but they are not enough to counter persistent oversupply.  Technically, trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $64.25 will set the tone.", "analysis": 2}, "190": {"title": "Fears Of An Oil Price Crash On A Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire Overdone", "source": "OilPrice.com", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Fears-Of-An-Oil-Price-Crash-On-A-Russia-Ukraine-Ceasefire-Overdone.html", "date": "2025-08-15T00:00:00+00:00", "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump has, over the past couple of weeks, renewed efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, going as far as proposing the swapping of territories between the two countries. Unlike the situation during the first meeting between Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin earlier in the year, Trump has adopted a far less conciliatory tone ahead of their second meeting in Alaska on August 15th, warning that Russia will face \"very severe consequences\" unless Putin agrees to end the war in Ukraine. However, the White House says it expects the Anchorage summit to be a \"listening exercise,\" downplaying the odds of a peace deal being reached.  Still, the potential of a return of more Russian energy commodities to the markets has depressed oil and gas prices amid expectations that a breakthrough in the negotiations could see sanctions on Russian exports lifted. Brent crude has pulled back from a 2-month high of $72.47 per barrel recorded two weeks ago to $66.72 per barrel in Thursday's intraday session, while WTI crude has declined from $70.00 per barrel to $63.81. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that fears that oil prices will crash if Trump manages to negotiate a truce with Putin are overdone. First off, StanChart says that Russia has been producing unsustainably at its maximum capacity with long-term consequences for its reservoirs. The country's oil production averaged 9.01 million barrels per day mb/d in H1-2025, about 610,000 b/d lower than the 2021 annual average before the invasion of Ukraine. A lifting of export sanctions will mean a return of Western service companies and Russia being able to access quality replacement parts; however, Russia just doesn't have a lot of spare production capacity to flood the oil markets.  Related How Canada's Oil Sands Producers Pump More Crude from the Same Assets  Second, Russia might demand the removal of the oil price cap by Western nations as part of the peace deal. However, the analysts have pointed out that the removal of the price cap would eliminate the price advantage for India and China to take Russian crude, currently the biggest buyers of discounted Russian oil. StanChart points out that India has been an opportunistic purchaser of cheaper Russian crude, and could revert to its previous import volumes with dire consequences for Russia. Previously, we reported that India imported goods worth $65.7 billion from Russia in 2024, a sharp rise from $8.25 billion in 2021. India's imports of Russian crude have increased more than 20-fold since the war began, jumping to $52.2 billion in 2024 from just $2.31 billion four years ago. Given the additional efforts Russia has undertaken to evade export sanctions, StanChart has predicted that we are unlikely to see a large increase in Russian supply to the global markets in the near term. JP Morgan echoes StanChart's view, saying that Russia has limited scope to expand its shadow fleet of tankers used to transport its crude.  Finally, Russia might not dramatically increase its crude exports for the simple reason that there might not be a ready market for the commodity. After all, Europe has successfully cut its dependency on Russian oil and gas over the past three years, and the continent is highly unlikely to put itself in such a vulnerable position again, especially after Moscow revealed its willingness to weaponize its energy commodities. In the final analysis, StanChart says that although the market might react to positive ceasefire news by selling off in the near term, this would be sentiment- rather than fundamentally-driven, and any price-dip on headlines would likely be short-lived.  When it comes to natural gas, StanChart notes that market expectations of higher Russian flows have been a key factor capping European gas prices in recent times. European natural gas futures have declined to a 2-week low of 32.5/MWh amid robust supply and easing geopolitical risk. While a ceasefire agreement and the associated removal of sanctions by the U..S and EU could potentially allow more Russian gas into Europe, StanChart expects appetite for Russian gas to be limited given the past weaponization of flows. The commodity experts say that a more likely development would be the return of small flows via Ukraine into Hungary and Slovakia. Finally, StanChart says that it's highly unlikely that the Trump administration would agree to a deal that would disrupt its own LNG sector, with U.S. LNG having largely replaced Russian pipeline gas to Europe.

The coal hubs of northern China, in particular, were heavily affected by downpours that closed pits and disrupted transport.\u00a0The coal industry is also contending with government inspections targeting mines that produce above permitted levels. Meanwhile, pollution curbs to ensure blue skies for next month\u2019s military parade in Beijing are likely to keep the pressure on steel output, a large proportion of which is clustered around the capital.Thermal coal producers are shielded from swingeing cuts to production due to the country\u2019s reliance on the fuel for power generation, which has spiked over the summer as temperatures have soared. But the steel industry \u2014 and the miners that deliver coking coal for its blast furnaces \u2014 have much less protection.Property Collapse\u00a0The collapse in China\u2019s property market has stripped back a key pillar of demand. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that excess steel capacity last year was 142 million tons, almost four times the level in 2020. A boom in exports has taken up some of the slack, but rising protectionism around the world is likely to cap sales.Among other building materials, both cement and glass production continued to fall sharply. Aluminum output stayed elevated as profits at smelters rose due to the drop in alumina costs.For fossil fuels, refining restarts after maintenance and improved margins saw crude oil processing rise 8.9% year-on-year. Oil and gas output continued to rise in line with the government\u2019s energy security goals.\u00a0\u2014With assistance from Katharine Gemmell, Sarah Chen, Winnie Zhu, Kathy Chen and Martin Ritchie.(Updates to add chart and extra details in final paragraphs)", "analysis": 1}, "194": {"title": "APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) Shares Purchased by National Bank of Canada FI", "source": "ETF Daily News", "link": "https://www.etfdailynews.com/2025/08/15/apa-corporation-nasdaqapa-shares-purchased-by-national-bank-of-canada-fi/", "date": "2025-08-15T08:58:52+00:00", "body": "National Bank of Canada FI boosted its holdings in  APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA \u2013 Free Report) by 76.4% in the first quarter, according to the company in its most recent Form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

President Irfaan Ali's PPP/C government is seeking a second term, with opposition alliances trying to consolidate ground. But overshadowing it all is Maduro's escalating rhetoric over a Russian-style annexation of the Essequibo region, Guyana's oil-rich western territory that Venezuela has long claimed. Venezuela recently went ahead with elections for officials to govern Essequibo, despite a ruling by the International Court of Justice ordering a halt, and even though the world still recognizes the region as Guyanese territory. In recent weeks, Maduro's tone has sharpened, with talk of annexation, threats of partial conquest, and veiled warnings to international partners like ExxonMobil. Some analysts believe his strategy is about more than borders it's a nationalist gambit to consolidate domestic support amid economic pains, while testing whether the U.S. and CARICOM will back their Guyanese partner without hesitating.  The Iraqi federal government in Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government KRG in Erbil have agreed on a framework to resume crude exports through Turkey's Ceyhan terminal, potentially ending months of political deadlock over control, revenue-sharing, and pipeline access. The deal includes provisions for meeting KRG domestic demand around 50,000 bpd with the remainder to be marketed through Iraq's SOMO. While it makes for a good headline, the agreement does not set a date for the restart. Turkey has yet to give formal clearance, and technical checks on the pipeline still need to be completed. For now, consider it a blueprint for an operational restart. Past public statements from Iraqi officials predicting an imminent resumption have failed to materialize, and there are still contractual and logistical issues to resolve before flows can resume.  Beijing's security service is claiming it shut down a smuggling ring run by a foreign intelligence agency to get rare earths out of the country by using false labels, faking origin documents and mixing with everyday goods for routing through third countries. Beijing isn't naming names; instead, it's sending a message that this is being treated not as a trade issue, but as a matter of national security. Smuggling will be considered espionage. This plays into the broader clampdown we've been watching all year. Exports of other controlled minerals like antimony and germanium have collapsed down more than 80% since January because of tighter licensing and more aggressive enforcement. Now they're linking those controls directly to counter-intelligence work.  Discovery &amp; Development  ExxonMobil XOM landed a massive deepwater prize in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, securing acreage bigger than the country itself and eyeing up to $21.7B in potential investment if commercial reserves are found. The initial $42M program will fund 3D seismic and up to two wells, with drilling possible in six months, as Exxon looks to copy-paste its Guyana 11B boe success. Existing infrastructure could fast-track any discovery to market, unlike Guyana's early days, while shared resources between the two countries promise lower costs and faster timelines. PM Kamla Persad signaled fiscal terms will be sweetened to lure more capital, underscoring Port of Spain's determination not to miss out before the global energy window narrows.  Azule Energy, the BPEni JV, is moving to fast-track development of its Capricornus oil find offshore Namibia's Block 2914A, aiming for first oil by 2029 if an FID can be pulled off by late 2026. The company, which took its stake from Rhino Resources last year, hit oil in April and is already weighing development options, with the possibility of taking over operatorship during that phase. Namibia has become one of the industry's hottest new frontiers since TotalEnergies and Shell struck major discoveries three years ago, but recent dry holes and Shell's $400 million writedown have tempered some of the hype. CEO Adriano Mangini says Azule is confident in its reservoir quality and is \"ready to stay in Namibia for many years,\" setting up a race with Rhino and others to be the country's first crude producer.  TotalEnergies is gearing up to drill up to seven wells offshore South Africa in the Deep Western Orange Basin, about 211 km from Saldanha Bay, in a campaign that could start as early as 2026. The basin sits adjacent to Namibia's recent blockbuster finds, and Total is chasing similar geology after scoring big there in 2022. Rival Shell also plans as many as five wells in the Northern Cape Ultra Deep block, having secured environmental approval in June. Both majors face a legal landscape shaped by recent environmental court wins that have stalled other South African offshore projects.  Norway has officially opened its northernmost oil field, Johan Castberg, operated by Equinor 46.3% with partners Vr Energi 30% and Petoro 23.7%. Located in the Barents Sea, the 450600 MMbbl field draws from the Skrugard, Havis, and Drivis discoveries and is expected to produce for 30 years. First oil was achieved on March 31, with output already hitting its 220,000 bpd peak capacity in under three months. Energy Minister Terje Aasland called it a milestone for the region, adding that the Barents now hosts Norway's second-largest producing oil field, second-largest gas field, and its biggest discovery under development.  Petrobras has secured regulatory clearance to conduct emergency response drills in Brazil's Foz do Amazonas basin on Aug. 24, a decisive step toward securing its long-delayed exploration license. The Atlantic acreage, 330 miles from the Amazon River's mouth, is seen as critical to offsetting a national production peak expected around 2030, with Petrobras budgeting $3 billion for the Equatorial Margin campaign. Environmental regulator Ibama has blocked drilling there for over a decade due to spill risks, but the upcoming three-to-four-day pre-operational assessment is considered the final hurdle before an exploration permit. Petrobras says it's ready to spud immediately, eyeing potential Guyana-scale upside after Exxon's multibillion-barrel discoveries to the north.  Libya's NOC has announced a new oil discovery in the Ghadames Basin from the A-65/2 well, operated by Sonatrach subsidiary SIPEX. Initial test flows came in at about 4,200 bpd, confirming commercial potential. The find is part of a broader push by NOC to restart rigs and expand drilling in the basin, with three more wells planned. The discovery adds to Libya's efforts to boost production capacity after years of underinvestment and conflict-related outages.  SBM Offshore's FPSO One Guyana has started production at ExxonMobil's Yellowtail development in the Stabroek block, marking the country's fourth producing FPSO and boosting total installed capacity to over 900,000 bpd. Yellowtail, sanctioned in 2022, is Guyana's largest oil project to date, with six drill centers, up to 26 producers and 25 injectors, and an initial average output of 250,000 bpd. First oil came four months ahead of schedule, with the two-million-barrel-capacity unit joining the Liza Destiny, Liza Unity, and Prosperity FPSOs producing Golden Arrowhead crude. ExxonMobil, with partners Hess Chevron and CNOOC, targets 1.7 million boe/d capacity from eight Guyana developments by 2030.  Deals, Mergers &amp; Acquisitions  Santos has extended the due diligence and exclusivity period for a potential $5.76/share takeover by an ADNOC-led consortium, pushing the deadline to Aug. 22. The groupwhich includes Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co. and Carlylehas \"substantially completed\" its review and found no deal-breaking issues, reaffirming its commitment to a binding agreement. The offer, up from earlier bids of $5.04 and $5.42, would see the consortium acquire all ordinary shares and expand Santos' gas and LNG portfolio to target 2025 mtpa capacity by 2035. Santos, operating in Australia, PNG, Timor-Leste and the U.S., previously scrapped merger talks with Woodside in 2024.  Duke Energy plans to merge its two main North Carolina utilitiesDuke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinasinto a single entity with uniform rates across its service area. The company says the merger, slated for January 2027 pending approval, would generate $1 billion in customer savings through 2038. The move follows the passage of North Carolina's Power Bill Reduction Act, which allows Duke to recover ongoing capital costs and removes the state's 2030 carbon-reduction mandate. Duke expects the consolidation to streamline operations and improve cost efficiency as it ramps up new generation projects.  Energy Earnings  Petrobras posted Q2 net income of 26.7B reais $4.89B, reversing a 2.6B reais loss from the prior year as higher output and cost controls offset weaker crude prices. Daily production topped 2M bpd, while adjusted EBITDA rose 5.1% to 52.3B reais despite Brent averaging $67.82/bbl versus $75.66 in Q1. The company approved 8.66B reais in dividends and interest payments, alongside $1.6B in advance dividends for FY2025. Capex reached $4.4B in the quarterup 30.6% YoYfocused on pre-salt Santos Basin development and new FPSO builds.  Constellation Energy posted Q2 2025 GAAP net income of $2.67/share and adjusted operating earnings of $1.91/share, up from $1.68 a year ago, driven by strong Generation and Commercial business performance. The company secured a 20-year PPA with Meta for the full output of its Clinton Clean Energy Center, received regulatory approvals for its Calpine acquisition, and advanced the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center to 2027. Nuclear fleet output held steady at over 45,000 GWh with a 94.8% capacity factor, while the gas and renewables fleet maintained high dispatch and capture rates.

Trump's billing it as a shot at ending the Ukraine war, but let's keep some perspective he's been saying \"two weeks\" since the campaign trail and has repeated it in office like a mantra. Nothing on the battlefield or in politics has shifted in his favor, yet markets are trading this as if an outcome is baked inand the outcome is expected to be more Russian barrels on the market. It's not likely grounded in much reality, but it's the pull of the optics. The image of Trump and Putin sitting down in Alaska may move markets for a few hours, but both men are walking in with hard, pre-set positions and no appetite for real concessions. The stagecraft will be there; the fundamentals will not change.  Putin is coming in with his usual posture willing to talk, unwilling to give up what he's taken. He's stress-testing the alliance. If he can coax Trump into floating ideas that would readjust NATO's red lines such as recognizing current front lines, rolling back some sanctions without a withdrawal, and slowing Ukraine's NATO path, he'll be watching how Europe reacts. Do Berlin, Paris, Warsaw, and London close ranks immediately, or does anyone hedge their language, drag their feet There is also high-level PR value here. Just being in Anchorage after years of isolation is a win he can take home and sell. It's proof, in his narrative, that Washington has to meet him on equal terms.  Trump has floated the idea of a follow-up with Zelenskyy, but for now, Ukraine's out of the room, and European capitals aren't thrilled. As for the chatter about Trump giving Russia access to Alaskan natural resources in the Bering Strait, that's media fantasy. It's hard to imagine a scenario where Washington hands over domestic asset rights to beg Putin to end the war. Trump's image would never survive such a thing, and there is no clear incentive to back up this speculation.  No serious observers will expect a major breakthrough today. This is theater, and in that sense, it serves both men. But by letting the expectations balloon, the White House is setting itself up for market and political whiplash depending on the level of theater.  In the meantime, there have been some peace developments in a different theater Armenia and Azerbaijan.  Yerevan and Baku have put their names to a U.S.-brokered peace accord that recognizes each other's borders, renounces force, and greenlights a transit corridor across southern Armenia linking Azerbaijan proper to Nakhchivan and on to Turkey. The route stays under Armenian jurisdiction, but Washington gets exclusive development rights commercial, not military and will subcontract the build-out. That's the core. Everything else is positioned around it. The narrative has since been focused on Moscow and Tehran. Russia has offered the polite \"welcome\" while warning against \"foreign meddling,\" its way of keeping the door open for a Russian role in monitoring or customs. Iran's line is harder public threats to block the corridor, framing it as a U.S. foothold on its northern border, and pushing back on talk of any 99-year arrangement. Armenian envoys are already telling Tehran there will be no foreign security presence, but that won't stop Iran from testing the limits with military drills along the Aras, bureaucratic interference, or prodding Armenian opposition to slow ratification. On the Azerbaijani side, there's a built-in brake. Baku wants Armenia to amend the constitutional language it sees as implying territorial claims; Yerevan hasn't delivered, and doing so quickly is politically costly. That gives Aliyev an easy excuse to pace the corridor's rollout.", "analysis": 1}, "204": {"title": "Europe on Edge Ahead of Trump-Putin Meeting", "source": "OilPrice.com", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Europe-on-Edge-Ahead-of-Trump-Putin-Meeting.html", "date": "2025-08-15T15:00:00+00:00", "body": "As Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump prepare to meet in Alaska for a high-stakes summit to discuss ending the 43-month-old war in Ukraine, a deep feeling of unease is gripping European capitals, especially Kyiv.  The August 15 meeting between the two leaders, their first since Trump returned to the presidency in January, could reshape not only Ukraine's future borders but also European security without either Kyiv or Brussels having a say.  Trump has made ending the conflict -- Europe's largest since World War II -- a top foreign policy priority. Confident in his deal-making skills and friendly relationship with Putin, Trump believes that goal can be achieved starting with the one-to-one meeting announced only a week ago.  Since then, Western officials and experts have expressed concern that Trump, who eschews traditional diplomatic procedures in favor of deal-making, will be outwitted by Putin, who has more than a quarter-century of experience negotiating with Western leaders.  When he told reporters that he and Putin would discuss the possibility of land swaps between Russia and Ukraine, the anxiety level rose over fears that he could recognize the Kremlin's land grab, appeasing the aggressor.  The surprise announcement of the summit sent Ukrainian and European leaders scrambling to get face time with Trump. While European leaders expressed a sigh of relief following a conference call with Trump on August 13, what the 79-year-old US leader will agree to in Alaska is anyone's guess, experts said.  \"I think it's really worth noting how remarkable it is that there is such a high degree of uncertainty of what's going to come out of this meeting,\" said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, senior fellow and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security CNAS.  \"It has been exceptionally difficult to gauge what President Trump's views on Ukraine are, in large part because there have been flip flops and U-turns, and it has been inconsistent from start to finish,\" she said on August 14 in a conference call with reporters.  Trump, who has expressed admiration for Putin over the years, tore into Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February during a meeting in the Oval Office that shocked the Western world.  A few months later, Trump was focusing his ire on Putin for not agreeing to his demand for a 30-day cease-fire. Despite his rhetoric and threats of sanctions, Trump hasn't imposed any penalties on Russia to date. Kendall-Taylor said that is a sign that Trump's affinity is still with Russia and Putin.  On the eve of the summit, Trump continued to keep everyone guessing about its outcome. As he played down the chances for any breakthrough in Alaska, Trump told Fox News that Putin's \"going to make a deal.\"  He also told Fox News that he might be willing to stay in Alaska for a three-way meeting, including Zelenskyy, if he makes progress with the Russian leader.  Zelenskyy on August 14 was in in London to discuss security with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a show of British support. He and other European leaders want to ensure their interests are taken into account when Trump and Putin meet.  In Moscow, Putin praised Trump's efforts to end the war in a short video released by the Kremlin, saying the White House is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities\" and to \"reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved.\"  But there is plenty of skepticism about Putin's true intentions to match the high degree of anxiety in Ukraine.  \"Already the fact that this meeting is happening is not playing in Ukraine's favor,\" said Olga Tokariuk, a fellow with the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis CEPA.  The opposite is true for Russia \"because it legitimizes Putin,\" Tokariuk said, speaking during a conference call on August 14. \"He gets a meeting with the US president on the US soil without any concessions on his side.\"  The worst-case scenario would be if Ukraine is forced to make some territorial concessions without any security guarantees in return, said Tokariuk. Ukraine worries that this would only lead to renewed Russian aggression within a couple of months.  \"If there is no accountability for Russia for having started this full-scale war in 2022 that will just encourage Russia to come back for more,\" Tokariuk said.  Kendall-Taylor said that one risk for Ukraine is that Putin might be able to \"reframe\" Trump's view of Zelenskyy as the barrier to ending the war.  The danger is that if Putin talks about his genuine desire to end the war and makes some \"reasonable looking proposals that Ukraine will have to reject,\" Zelenskyy could find himself back in Trump's crosshairs as the obstinate and uncompromising figure,\" said Kendall-Taylor, who served as deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the US National Intelligence Council from 2015-2018.  There is also skepticism that threatening Putin with tariffs is enough to curb his territorial ambitions. Trump will have to be forceful, said Richard Haas, a former high-ranking State Department official who helped negotiate peace deals on behalf of the United States under previous administrations.  \"If you really want to change Putin's calculus you've got to disabuse Putin of one notion that time is on his side, [and] that by continuing this war Russia will gradually grind and grind and grind and get what it wants,\" Haas said in an interview with US broadcaster CBS. \"All President Trump has to do is say, 'Vlad, ain't gonna happen.'\"  The talks come at a pivotal moment, with Trump increasingly frustrated with Putin and the Russian president showing no signs of bending on the Kremlin's maximalist demands. Trump and Putin have held six phone calls, and the White House's lead envoy has traveled to Moscow at least three times.  Zelenskyy said he and Starmer discussed \"in considerable detail\" the security guarantees that Ukraine has said would be necessary for it to agree to a cease-fire.  Trump said in his Fox News interview that if he called Zelenskyy for a three-way meeting with himself and Putin, it would be \"very, very important, because that's going to be a meeting where they make a deal.\" He also again alluded to territorial swaps.  \"I don't want to use the word 'divvy things up,' but you know, to a certain extent, it's not a bad term, OK\" he said.  Trump previously said to end the conflict both sides will have to swap land to end intense fighting that has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides and displaced millions of Ukrainians.  But French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump was \"very clear\" in a call on August 13 that he wants to achieve a cease-fire at the summit and that Trump had been clear that \"territorial issues relating to Ukraine...will only be negotiated by the Ukrainian president.\"  \"Trump's thinking is apparently closer aligned with that of the Europeans than first feared by some,\" one European official told RFE/RL after the call.  Trump has warned Russia of \"very severe consequences\" if it doesn't halt its war against Ukraine, but has given no details on what consequences Moscow could face.  If Trump's insistence on involving Ukraine is confirmed, it would help ease fears among Ukraine, but Russia has consistently given the idea of a meeting with Zelenskyy the cold shoulder, suggesting it should only happen once the sides are close to signing a peace deal, not just a cease-fire agreement.  That moment seems far off, given the huge gap between the Russian and Ukrainian positions that persists on several major issues, including territory and security, despite three rounds of direct talks in Turkey since mid-May.

This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Hence, their business model is relatively low-risk, which indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.Kinder Morgan:\u00a0With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 79,000 miles, KMI is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America.

Despite the increase, China's oil product exports last month were also up from a year ago, suggesting lower domestic fuel demand.Forecasts of a growing oil market surplus also weighed on sentiment, as did the prospect of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates.Oil rig count, an indicator of future supply, rose by one to 412 this week, Baker Hughes data showed.Bank of America analysts said on Thursday that they were widening their forecast for the oil market surplus, citing growing supplies from the OPEC+ producer group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allies.The analysts now project an average surplus of 890,000 barrels per day from July 2025 through June 2026.", "analysis": 2}, "210": {"title": "Factbox-Russian energy facilities targeted in drone attacks", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/factbox-russian-energy-facilities-targeted-093424040.html", "date": "2025-08-15T09:34:24+00:00", "body": "(Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, with energy markets watching closely for...", "analysis": 1}, "211": {"title": "Oil and fuel prices hang in the balance as Trump and Putin meet to broker peace", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-fuel-prices-hang-balance-090000229.html", "date": "2025-08-15T09:00:00+00:00", "body": "Much will be on the line in geopolitics when President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet Friday in Alaska, in hope of brokering a peace accord in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

Peace means lower fuel prices for consumers, even as a bearish oil sector turns increasingly pessimistic about the months and year ahead. On the other hand: Hardening stances and increased sanctions against Russia and buyers of Russian oil would add pain at the pump, while potentially reinvigorating a languishing oil industry and driving higher revenues, analysts said.Regardless of the direction, incremental pricing swings are expected\u2014and not any dramatic boom or bust. Russia can only add so much oil to the global marketplace if sanctions are removed. The problem for the already slowed oil sector is that even smaller downward pricing changes can exacerbate the industry\u2019s struggles, given that OPEC has notably hiked its production volumes this year.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big wall of oil coming from Russia if peace breaks out,\u201d said energy forecaster Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer for Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm. \u201cMy expectation is there\u2019s a more significant impact on sentiment\u2014\u2018Here come the Russians\u2019\u2014than there would be on actual barrels.\u201dRussia produced 9.05 million barrels per day of crude oil in the second quarter of 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and analysts expect Russia could add back maybe 200,000 barrels daily in the short-to-medium term. That would represent a marked uptick, but not enough to truly upend oil markets.\u201cIn a bullish market, the market probably shrugs it off. In a bearish market, every supply-related data point gets a little more weight than it probably should,\u201d Pickering said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bigger risk to sentiment than to the actual supply of oil.\u201dThe main reason: Western sanctions on Russian oil haven\u2019t been all that effective since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. China, India, and other buyers simply imported much more Russian oil, utilizing the so-called dark fleet of oil tankers that uses deceptive tactics to conceal what they\u2019re shipping.Still, Russian volumes have dipped from an estimated 9.2 million barrels daily in 2024 and from 9.6 million barrels in 2023, according to the DOE.", "analysis": 2}, "212": {"title": "What a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal could mean for global markets", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russias-war-ukraine-shaped-global-083317673.html", "date": "2025-08-15T08:33:17+00:00", "body": "LONDON (Reuters) -World markets are watching closely as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin meet in Alaska later on Friday to seal a possible ceasefire agreement in Ukraine.This is a conflict that sparked an energy shock, sent food prices soaring, battered European assets and cut Russia's economy off from much of the Western world.Details and the longevity of any agreement will be key, and for now investors are on standby.

Brent crude rose as much as 30% to $139 a barrel, while natural gas prices soared nearly 300% to record highs.Crude subsided in the following months. But Dutch TTF futures, the regional benchmark for natural gas, soared as Europe scrambled for an alternative to the Russian gas that fed over 40% of total demand.Europe has since become increasingly reliant on U.S. super-chilled liquefied natural gas.

Buys Another U.S. Crude Cargo", "source": "OilPrice.com", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Indian-Oil-Corp-Buys-Another-US-Crude-Cargo.html", "date": "2025-08-15T07:15:00+00:00", "body": "Indian Oil Corp has bought another cargo of U.S. West Texas Intermediate for delivery in October, Reuters reported today, citing unnamed industry sources.  The deal is part of a recent streak of U.S. oil purchases following President Trump&rsquo;s threat to impose additional tariffs on Indian exporters to the United States if the country continues buying Russian crude.  The October deal was priced at a premium of between $2.80 and $2.90 to dated Brent, Reuters&rsquo; sources said.  It is price that pushed India to step up Russian oil purchases in the first place, turning Russia from a minor exporter to the subcontinent, into one of its top crude oil suppliers, accounting for about a third of total imports.  India&rsquo;s government reacted negatively to Trump&rsquo;s threat, saying it had no intention of suspending oil imports from Russia, noting that the United States and the European Union were still buying energy commodities from Russia despite a barrage of energy sanctions on the latter.  Yet reports have been coming in about a pivot to U.S. oil as well as oil from other regions. Earlier this month, Indian Oil Corp. bought 2 million barrels of U.S. Mars crude, another 2 million barrels of Brazilian oil, and 1 million barrels of Libyan crude, Reuters sources said last week. These deals follow the securing of 8 million barrels by Indian Oil Corp. from sellers in the Middle East, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria.  Meanwhile, however, Tankers loaded with Russian crude that had stayed idle off India&rsquo;s coast for days discharged their cargo at Indian oil import terminals earlier this month, in defiance of the U.S. threats, Bloomberg reported, with the total discharged at 3 million barrels of Russian Urals, the flagship grade that Russia exports to Asia.  Shunning Russian oil entirely would add an estimated $20 billion to India&rsquo;s oil import bill over a period of two years, according to analyst calculations.

As of 937 a.m. EST on Friday, the U.S. benchmark oil price, WTI Crude, was down by 1.38% at $63.10, as President Trump departed for Anchorage, Alaska, to meet with Putin.  The international benchmark, Brent Crude, traded 1.18% lower at $66.07 per barrel.  The face-to-face meeting between President Trump and Putin is expected to begin around 3 p.m. EST and it's unclear how long it would take.  President Trump on Thursday threatened \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire agreement.  The market struggles to anticipate what the outcome of the Trump-Putin meeting will be. Some analysts are concerned that President Trump could agree to Russian terms that could include territorial concession by Ukraine.  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that decisions about Ukraine taken in his absence would be meaningless.  Trump has signaled he would at a later stage work for a meeting that would include Zelenskyy.  According to A/S Global Risk Management's chief analyst Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, the Friday meeting \"is unlikely to deliver significant results.\"  \"If a follow-up meeting is agreed, Trump may seek to place responsibility on Putin and Zelenskiy,\" Rasmussen told Bloomberg.  \"In the near term, new US sanctions are unlikely; a relaxation cannot be ruled out unless the meeting collapses,\" the analyst added.  A relaxation of the U.S. sanctions against Russia could increase concerns about oversupply on the market later this year and early 2026.  \"The geopolitical risk premium tied to the TrumpPutin meeting in Alaska is now a secondary driver, and unless talks break down sharply, the macro drag from the demand outlook may keep a lid on rallies, with Brent potentially struggling above USD 70 per barrel,\" Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a Friday note.

The week was shaped by several high-impact fundamental eventsnone of which proved decisive enough to shift the balance away from oversupply and tepid demand. Traders were focused on Friday's Trump-Putin meeting, but until concrete action disrupts physical flows, the dominant pressure remains rooted in inventories and production.  Trump-Putin Meeting Raises Risk, But Market Demands Proof  The most closely watched event of the week is Friday's planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Trump has threatened \"severe consequences\" should Putin fail to pursue peace in Ukraine, including potential secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian crudeparticularly China and India.  India alone sourced roughly 1.8 million barrels per day from Russia in the first half of the year, amounting to 37% of its total crude imports. Targeting these flows would represent a major shift in global balances, particularly for medium sour grades.  However, the market has shown skepticism. Traders remain unconvinced that Trump will follow through, given past patterns of backing away from aggressive rhetoric. Without formal sanctions or actual export disruptions, the geopolitical risk is being treated as a background factornot a directional force.  IEA and EIA Reports Add to Bearish Pressure  The supply-demand imbalance was reinforced this week by bearish signals from both the International Energy Agency IEA and the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA. The IEA raised its global supply forecast, citing stronger-than-expected output from OPEC and non-OPEC producers. Simultaneously, it trimmed its demand estimate due to persistent weakness in major economies, especially in Europe and Asia.  The EIA's weekly report showed a surprise 3 million barrel build in U.S. crude inventories, compared to expectations for a modest draw. Commercial crude stocks rose to 426.7 million barrels, while net imports surged by nearly 700,000 barrels per day. U.S. exports, meanwhile, declinedreflecting soft global demand for American crude.  Product data was mixed, with gasoline drawing down slightly and distillates increasing. Overall, the figures point to a market that is oversupplied and underdrawn, particularly given that refinery runs remain elevated and seasonal demand is near its peak. The lack of any tightening trend is weighing on sentiment.  Tariff Pause Provides Short-Term Relief but No Resolution  President Trump's decision to delay new tariffs on Chinese goods until November 10 provided temporary relief to global markets. Traders had been bracing for another escalation in trade restrictions, which could have hurt industrial activity and transportation fuel demand.  While the pause has removed immediate downside risk tied to trade policy, it does not suggest an agreement is near. The move was interpreted more as a political calculation than an economic strategy. For crude markets, this means that any demand boost is likely to be modest and temporary unless broader trade flows improve.  Rate Cut Expectations Help But Don't Reverse the Trend  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates in September, following weak U.S. employment data and a moderate inflation reading in July. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added to that speculation by suggesting a 50 basis point move could be warranted. But Thursday's hotter-than-expected PPI data, has taken the \"big\" cut off the table.  Rate cuts typically support crude demand by lowering borrowing costs, stimulating consumption, and weakening the dollar. While this has added a marginal boost to sentiment, the physical crude market remains weighed down by oversupply. Unless easier financial conditions translate into sustained product draws or stronger refinery runs, the impact on pricing will be limited.  OPEC Holds Steady While Non-OPEC Supply Grows  OPEC showed no sign of making new output adjustments this week, as members wait to see how global balances evolve. UBS revised its year-end Brent forecast downward to $62, citing resilient sanctioned exports and growing South American supply.  Guyana, in particular, continues to ramp up faster than expected. An Exxon-led consortium began production at a new offshore vessel four months ahead of schedule, adding barrels to an already saturated market. These barrels are increasingly finding buyers in the Atlantic Basin and adding pressure to traditional West African and Middle Eastern flows.  Saudi Arabia announced a cut in crude exports to China for September, lowering volumes to 1.43 million barrels per day from August's 1.65 million. However, the move coincided with higher official selling prices, which has reduced interest from major Asian refiners. Indian refiners received full Saudi allocations but did not request additional barrelssuggesting demand caution rather than supply constraint.  Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures    Trend Indicator Analysis  The main trend is down, according to the weekly swing chart. This week's trade through $62.69 changed the trend. Taking out $70.51 will change the main trend to up.  The market also crossed to the bearish side of the 52-week moving average at $64.25, which is a sign of weakness. Crude oil is also edging on the weak side of a pair of 50% levels at $64.13 and $65.37, indicating increasing downside pressure.  Weekly Technical Forecast  The direction of the Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures market the week ending August 22 is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $64.25.  Bullish Scenario  A sustained move over $64.25 will signal the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum, we could see a near-term rally through the long-term pivot at $65.37 with all eyes on a return to the swing top at $70.51.  Bearish Scenario  A sustained move under $64.25 will indicate the presence of sellers. This could lead to a quick test of the June low at $62.69. This price is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the downside with $52.00 to $51.00 the next potential targets.  Market Outlook Bearish Bias Unless Supply Disruption Emerges  While this week has introduced event risk from the Trump-Putin summit and central bank speculation, neither has changed the fundamental backdrop. Crude oil markets are well-supplied, global demand remains soft, and inventories are not drawing at a pace consistent with a bullish rebalancing.  Unless the U.S. enacts sanctions that materially reduce Russian exports, or unless next week's EIA data reveals a significant draw, crude is likely to remain under pressure. Traders are watching for signs of tighter physical balances, but so far, the signals continue to point lower.  The most probable outcome is continued range trading with a downward bias. Risk events remain in focus, but they are not enough to counter persistent oversupply.  Technically, trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $64.25 will set the tone.", "analysis": 2}, "232": {"title": "Fears Of An Oil Price Crash On A Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire Overdone", "source": "OilPrice.com", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Fears-Of-An-Oil-Price-Crash-On-A-Russia-Ukraine-Ceasefire-Overdone.html", "date": "2025-08-15T00:00:00+00:00", "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump has, over the past couple of weeks, renewed efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, going as far as proposing the swapping of territories between the two countries. Unlike the situation during the first meeting between Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin earlier in the year, Trump has adopted a far less conciliatory tone ahead of their second meeting in Alaska on August 15th, warning that Russia will face \"very severe consequences\" unless Putin agrees to end the war in Ukraine. However, the White House says it expects the Anchorage summit to be a \"listening exercise,\" downplaying the odds of a peace deal being reached.  Still, the potential of a return of more Russian energy commodities to the markets has depressed oil and gas prices amid expectations that a breakthrough in the negotiations could see sanctions on Russian exports lifted. Brent crude has pulled back from a 2-month high of $72.47 per barrel recorded two weeks ago to $66.72 per barrel in Thursday's intraday session, while WTI crude has declined from $70.00 per barrel to $63.81. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that fears that oil prices will crash if Trump manages to negotiate a truce with Putin are overdone. First off, StanChart says that Russia has been producing unsustainably at its maximum capacity with long-term consequences for its reservoirs. The country's oil production averaged 9.01 million barrels per day mb/d in H1-2025, about 610,000 b/d lower than the 2021 annual average before the invasion of Ukraine. A lifting of export sanctions will mean a return of Western service companies and Russia being able to access quality replacement parts; however, Russia just doesn't have a lot of spare production capacity to flood the oil markets.  Related How Canada's Oil Sands Producers Pump More Crude from the Same Assets  Second, Russia might demand the removal of the oil price cap by Western nations as part of the peace deal. However, the analysts have pointed out that the removal of the price cap would eliminate the price advantage for India and China to take Russian crude, currently the biggest buyers of discounted Russian oil. StanChart points out that India has been an opportunistic purchaser of cheaper Russian crude, and could revert to its previous import volumes with dire consequences for Russia. Previously, we reported that India imported goods worth $65.7 billion from Russia in 2024, a sharp rise from $8.25 billion in 2021. India's imports of Russian crude have increased more than 20-fold since the war began, jumping to $52.2 billion in 2024 from just $2.31 billion four years ago. Given the additional efforts Russia has undertaken to evade export sanctions, StanChart has predicted that we are unlikely to see a large increase in Russian supply to the global markets in the near term. JP Morgan echoes StanChart's view, saying that Russia has limited scope to expand its shadow fleet of tankers used to transport its crude.  Finally, Russia might not dramatically increase its crude exports for the simple reason that there might not be a ready market for the commodity. After all, Europe has successfully cut its dependency on Russian oil and gas over the past three years, and the continent is highly unlikely to put itself in such a vulnerable position again, especially after Moscow revealed its willingness to weaponize its energy commodities. In the final analysis, StanChart says that although the market might react to positive ceasefire news by selling off in the near term, this would be sentiment- rather than fundamentally-driven, and any price-dip on headlines would likely be short-lived.  When it comes to natural gas, StanChart notes that market expectations of higher Russian flows have been a key factor capping European gas prices in recent times. European natural gas futures have declined to a 2-week low of 32.5/MWh amid robust supply and easing geopolitical risk. While a ceasefire agreement and the associated removal of sanctions by the U..S and EU could potentially allow more Russian gas into Europe, StanChart expects appetite for Russian gas to be limited given the past weaponization of flows. The commodity experts say that a more likely development would be the return of small flows via Ukraine into Hungary and Slovakia. Finally, StanChart says that it's highly unlikely that the Trump administration would agree to a deal that would disrupt its own LNG sector, with U.S. LNG having largely replaced Russian pipeline gas to Europe.

The coal hubs of northern China, in particular, were heavily affected by downpours that closed pits and disrupted transport.\u00a0The coal industry is also contending with government inspections targeting mines that produce above permitted levels. Meanwhile, pollution curbs to ensure blue skies for next month\u2019s military parade in Beijing are likely to keep the pressure on steel output, a large proportion of which is clustered around the capital.Thermal coal producers are shielded from swingeing cuts to production due to the country\u2019s reliance on the fuel for power generation, which has spiked over the summer as temperatures have soared. But the steel industry \u2014 and the miners that deliver coking coal for its blast furnaces \u2014 have much less protection.Property Collapse\u00a0The collapse in China\u2019s property market has stripped back a key pillar of demand.

President Irfaan Ali's PPP/C government is seeking a second term, with opposition alliances trying to consolidate ground. But overshadowing it all is Maduro's escalating rhetoric over a Russian-style annexation of the Essequibo region, Guyana's oil-rich western territory that Venezuela has long claimed. Venezuela recently went ahead with elections for officials to govern Essequibo, despite a ruling by the International Court of Justice ordering a halt, and even though the world still recognizes the region as Guyanese territory. In recent weeks, Maduro's tone has sharpened, with talk of annexation, threats of partial conquest, and veiled warnings to international partners like ExxonMobil. Some analysts believe his strategy is about more than borders it's a nationalist gambit to consolidate domestic support amid economic pains, while testing whether the U.S. and CARICOM will back their Guyanese partner without hesitating.  The Iraqi federal government in Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government KRG in Erbil have agreed on a framework to resume crude exports through Turkey's Ceyhan terminal, potentially ending months of political deadlock over control, revenue-sharing, and pipeline access. The deal includes provisions for meeting KRG domestic demand around 50,000 bpd with the remainder to be marketed through Iraq's SOMO. While it makes for a good headline, the agreement does not set a date for the restart. Turkey has yet to give formal clearance, and technical checks on the pipeline still need to be completed. For now, consider it a blueprint for an operational restart. Past public statements from Iraqi officials predicting an imminent resumption have failed to materialize, and there are still contractual and logistical issues to resolve before flows can resume.  Beijing's security service is claiming it shut down a smuggling ring run by a foreign intelligence agency to get rare earths out of the country by using false labels, faking origin documents and mixing with everyday goods for routing through third countries. Beijing isn't naming names; instead, it's sending a message that this is being treated not as a trade issue, but as a matter of national security. Smuggling will be considered espionage. This plays into the broader clampdown we've been watching all year. Exports of other controlled minerals like antimony and germanium have collapsed down more than 80% since January because of tighter licensing and more aggressive enforcement. Now they're linking those controls directly to counter-intelligence work.  Discovery &amp; Development  ExxonMobil XOM landed a massive deepwater prize in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, securing acreage bigger than the country itself and eyeing up to $21.7B in potential investment if commercial reserves are found. The initial $42M program will fund 3D seismic and up to two wells, with drilling possible in six months, as Exxon looks to copy-paste its Guyana 11B boe success. Existing infrastructure could fast-track any discovery to market, unlike Guyana's early days, while shared resources between the two countries promise lower costs and faster timelines. PM Kamla Persad signaled fiscal terms will be sweetened to lure more capital, underscoring Port of Spain's determination not to miss out before the global energy window narrows.  Azule Energy, the BPEni JV, is moving to fast-track development of its Capricornus oil find offshore Namibia's Block 2914A, aiming for first oil by 2029 if an FID can be pulled off by late 2026. The company, which took its stake from Rhino Resources last year, hit oil in April and is already weighing development options, with the possibility of taking over operatorship during that phase. Namibia has become one of the industry's hottest new frontiers since TotalEnergies and Shell struck major discoveries three years ago, but recent dry holes and Shell's $400 million writedown have tempered some of the hype. CEO Adriano Mangini says Azule is confident in its reservoir quality and is \"ready to stay in Namibia for many years,\" setting up a race with Rhino and others to be the country's first crude producer.  TotalEnergies is gearing up to drill up to seven wells offshore South Africa in the Deep Western Orange Basin, about 211 km from Saldanha Bay, in a campaign that could start as early as 2026. The basin sits adjacent to Namibia's recent blockbuster finds, and Total is chasing similar geology after scoring big there in 2022. Rival Shell also plans as many as five wells in the Northern Cape Ultra Deep block, having secured environmental approval in June. Both majors face a legal landscape shaped by recent environmental court wins that have stalled other South African offshore projects.  Norway has officially opened its northernmost oil field, Johan Castberg, operated by Equinor 46.3% with partners Vr Energi 30% and Petoro 23.7%. Located in the Barents Sea, the 450600 MMbbl field draws from the Skrugard, Havis, and Drivis discoveries and is expected to produce for 30 years. First oil was achieved on March 31, with output already hitting its 220,000 bpd peak capacity in under three months. Energy Minister Terje Aasland called it a milestone for the region, adding that the Barents now hosts Norway's second-largest producing oil field, second-largest gas field, and its biggest discovery under development.  Petrobras has secured regulatory clearance to conduct emergency response drills in Brazil's Foz do Amazonas basin on Aug. 24, a decisive step toward securing its long-delayed exploration license. The Atlantic acreage, 330 miles from the Amazon River's mouth, is seen as critical to offsetting a national production peak expected around 2030, with Petrobras budgeting $3 billion for the Equatorial Margin campaign. Environmental regulator Ibama has blocked drilling there for over a decade due to spill risks, but the upcoming three-to-four-day pre-operational assessment is considered the final hurdle before an exploration permit. Petrobras says it's ready to spud immediately, eyeing potential Guyana-scale upside after Exxon's multibillion-barrel discoveries to the north.  Libya's NOC has announced a new oil discovery in the Ghadames Basin from the A-65/2 well, operated by Sonatrach subsidiary SIPEX. Initial test flows came in at about 4,200 bpd, confirming commercial potential. The find is part of a broader push by NOC to restart rigs and expand drilling in the basin, with three more wells planned. The discovery adds to Libya's efforts to boost production capacity after years of underinvestment and conflict-related outages.  SBM Offshore's FPSO One Guyana has started production at ExxonMobil's Yellowtail development in the Stabroek block, marking the country's fourth producing FPSO and boosting total installed capacity to over 900,000 bpd. Yellowtail, sanctioned in 2022, is Guyana's largest oil project to date, with six drill centers, up to 26 producers and 25 injectors, and an initial average output of 250,000 bpd. First oil came four months ahead of schedule, with the two-million-barrel-capacity unit joining the Liza Destiny, Liza Unity, and Prosperity FPSOs producing Golden Arrowhead crude. ExxonMobil, with partners Hess Chevron and CNOOC, targets 1.7 million boe/d capacity from eight Guyana developments by 2030.  Deals, Mergers &amp; Acquisitions  Santos has extended the due diligence and exclusivity period for a potential $5.76/share takeover by an ADNOC-led consortium, pushing the deadline to Aug. 22. The groupwhich includes Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co. and Carlylehas \"substantially completed\" its review and found no deal-breaking issues, reaffirming its commitment to a binding agreement. The offer, up from earlier bids of $5.04 and $5.42, would see the consortium acquire all ordinary shares and expand Santos' gas and LNG portfolio to target 2025 mtpa capacity by 2035. Santos, operating in Australia, PNG, Timor-Leste and the U.S., previously scrapped merger talks with Woodside in 2024.  Duke Energy plans to merge its two main North Carolina utilitiesDuke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinasinto a single entity with uniform rates across its service area. The company says the merger, slated for January 2027 pending approval, would generate $1 billion in customer savings through 2038. The move follows the passage of North Carolina's Power Bill Reduction Act, which allows Duke to recover ongoing capital costs and removes the state's 2030 carbon-reduction mandate. Duke expects the consolidation to streamline operations and improve cost efficiency as it ramps up new generation projects.  Energy Earnings  Petrobras posted Q2 net income of 26.7B reais $4.89B, reversing a 2.6B reais loss from the prior year as higher output and cost controls offset weaker crude prices. Daily production topped 2M bpd, while adjusted EBITDA rose 5.1% to 52.3B reais despite Brent averaging $67.82/bbl versus $75.66 in Q1. The company approved 8.66B reais in dividends and interest payments, alongside $1.6B in advance dividends for FY2025. Capex reached $4.4B in the quarterup 30.6% YoYfocused on pre-salt Santos Basin development and new FPSO builds.  Constellation Energy posted Q2 2025 GAAP net income of $2.67/share and adjusted operating earnings of $1.91/share, up from $1.68 a year ago, driven by strong Generation and Commercial business performance. The company secured a 20-year PPA with Meta for the full output of its Clinton Clean Energy Center, received regulatory approvals for its Calpine acquisition, and advanced the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center to 2027.

Trump's billing it as a shot at ending the Ukraine war, but let's keep some perspective he's been saying \"two weeks\" since the campaign trail and has repeated it in office like a mantra. Nothing on the battlefield or in politics has shifted in his favor, yet markets are trading this as if an outcome is baked inand the outcome is expected to be more Russian barrels on the market. It's not likely grounded in much reality, but it's the pull of the optics. The image of Trump and Putin sitting down in Alaska may move markets for a few hours, but both men are walking in with hard, pre-set positions and no appetite for real concessions. The stagecraft will be there; the fundamentals will not change.  Putin is coming in with his usual posture willing to talk, unwilling to give up what he's taken. He's stress-testing the alliance. If he can coax Trump into floating ideas that would readjust NATO's red lines such as recognizing current front lines, rolling back some sanctions without a withdrawal, and slowing Ukraine's NATO path, he'll be watching how Europe reacts. Do Berlin, Paris, Warsaw, and London close ranks immediately, or does anyone hedge their language, drag their feet There is also high-level PR value here. Just being in Anchorage after years of isolation is a win he can take home and sell. It's proof, in his narrative, that Washington has to meet him on equal terms.  Trump has floated the idea of a follow-up with Zelenskyy, but for now, Ukraine's out of the room, and European capitals aren't thrilled. As for the chatter about Trump giving Russia access to Alaskan natural resources in the Bering Strait, that's media fantasy. It's hard to imagine a scenario where Washington hands over domestic asset rights to beg Putin to end the war. Trump's image would never survive such a thing, and there is no clear incentive to back up this speculation.  No serious observers will expect a major breakthrough today. This is theater, and in that sense, it serves both men. But by letting the expectations balloon, the White House is setting itself up for market and political whiplash depending on the level of theater.  In the meantime, there have been some peace developments in a different theater Armenia and Azerbaijan.  Yerevan and Baku have put their names to a U.S.-brokered peace accord that recognizes each other's borders, renounces force, and greenlights a transit corridor across southern Armenia linking Azerbaijan proper to Nakhchivan and on to Turkey. The route stays under Armenian jurisdiction, but Washington gets exclusive development rights commercial, not military and will subcontract the build-out. That's the core. Everything else is positioned around it. The narrative has since been focused on Moscow and Tehran. Russia has offered the polite \"welcome\" while warning against \"foreign meddling,\" its way of keeping the door open for a Russian role in monitoring or customs. Iran's line is harder public threats to block the corridor, framing it as a U.S. foothold on its northern border, and pushing back on talk of any 99-year arrangement. Armenian envoys are already telling Tehran there will be no foreign security presence, but that won't stop Iran from testing the limits with military drills along the Aras, bureaucratic interference, or prodding Armenian opposition to slow ratification. On the Azerbaijani side, there's a built-in brake. Baku wants Armenia to amend the constitutional language it sees as implying territorial claims; Yerevan hasn't delivered, and doing so quickly is politically costly. That gives Aliyev an easy excuse to pace the corridor's rollout.", "analysis": 1}, "247": {"title": "Europe on Edge Ahead of Trump-Putin Meeting", "source": "OilPrice.com", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Europe-on-Edge-Ahead-of-Trump-Putin-Meeting.html", "date": "2025-08-15T15:00:00+00:00", "body": "As Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump prepare to meet in Alaska for a high-stakes summit to discuss ending the 43-month-old war in Ukraine, a deep feeling of unease is gripping European capitals, especially Kyiv.  The August 15 meeting between the two leaders, their first since Trump returned to the presidency in January, could reshape not only Ukraine's future borders but also European security without either Kyiv or Brussels having a say.  Trump has made ending the conflict -- Europe's largest since World War II -- a top foreign policy priority. Confident in his deal-making skills and friendly relationship with Putin, Trump believes that goal can be achieved starting with the one-to-one meeting announced only a week ago.  Since then, Western officials and experts have expressed concern that Trump, who eschews traditional diplomatic procedures in favor of deal-making, will be outwitted by Putin, who has more than a quarter-century of experience negotiating with Western leaders.  When he told reporters that he and Putin would discuss the possibility of land swaps between Russia and Ukraine, the anxiety level rose over fears that he could recognize the Kremlin's land grab, appeasing the aggressor.  The surprise announcement of the summit sent Ukrainian and European leaders scrambling to get face time with Trump. While European leaders expressed a sigh of relief following a conference call with Trump on August 13, what the 79-year-old US leader will agree to in Alaska is anyone's guess, experts said.  \"I think it's really worth noting how remarkable it is that there is such a high degree of uncertainty of what's going to come out of this meeting,\" said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, senior fellow and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security CNAS.  \"It has been exceptionally difficult to gauge what President Trump's views on Ukraine are, in large part because there have been flip flops and U-turns, and it has been inconsistent from start to finish,\" she said on August 14 in a conference call with reporters.  Trump, who has expressed admiration for Putin over the years, tore into Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February during a meeting in the Oval Office that shocked the Western world.  A few months later, Trump was focusing his ire on Putin for not agreeing to his demand for a 30-day cease-fire. Despite his rhetoric and threats of sanctions, Trump hasn't imposed any penalties on Russia to date. Kendall-Taylor said that is a sign that Trump's affinity is still with Russia and Putin.  On the eve of the summit, Trump continued to keep everyone guessing about its outcome. As he played down the chances for any breakthrough in Alaska, Trump told Fox News that Putin's \"going to make a deal.\"  He also told Fox News that he might be willing to stay in Alaska for a three-way meeting, including Zelenskyy, if he makes progress with the Russian leader.  Zelenskyy on August 14 was in in London to discuss security with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a show of British support. He and other European leaders want to ensure their interests are taken into account when Trump and Putin meet.  In Moscow, Putin praised Trump's efforts to end the war in a short video released by the Kremlin, saying the White House is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities\" and to \"reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved.\"  But there is plenty of skepticism about Putin's true intentions to match the high degree of anxiety in Ukraine.  \"Already the fact that this meeting is happening is not playing in Ukraine's favor,\" said Olga Tokariuk, a fellow with the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis CEPA.  The opposite is true for Russia \"because it legitimizes Putin,\" Tokariuk said, speaking during a conference call on August 14. \"He gets a meeting with the US president on the US soil without any concessions on his side.\"  The worst-case scenario would be if Ukraine is forced to make some territorial concessions without any security guarantees in return, said Tokariuk. Ukraine worries that this would only lead to renewed Russian aggression within a couple of months.  \"If there is no accountability for Russia for having started this full-scale war in 2022 that will just encourage Russia to come back for more,\" Tokariuk said.  Kendall-Taylor said that one risk for Ukraine is that Putin might be able to \"reframe\" Trump's view of Zelenskyy as the barrier to ending the war.  The danger is that if Putin talks about his genuine desire to end the war and makes some \"reasonable looking proposals that Ukraine will have to reject,\" Zelenskyy could find himself back in Trump's crosshairs as the obstinate and uncompromising figure,\" said Kendall-Taylor, who served as deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the US National Intelligence Council from 2015-2018.  There is also skepticism that threatening Putin with tariffs is enough to curb his territorial ambitions. Trump will have to be forceful, said Richard Haas, a former high-ranking State Department official who helped negotiate peace deals on behalf of the United States under previous administrations.  \"If you really want to change Putin's calculus you've got to disabuse Putin of one notion that time is on his side, [and] that by continuing this war Russia will gradually grind and grind and grind and get what it wants,\" Haas said in an interview with US broadcaster CBS. \"All President Trump has to do is say, 'Vlad, ain't gonna happen.'\"  The talks come at a pivotal moment, with Trump increasingly frustrated with Putin and the Russian president showing no signs of bending on the Kremlin's maximalist demands. Trump and Putin have held six phone calls, and the White House's lead envoy has traveled to Moscow at least three times.  Zelenskyy said he and Starmer discussed \"in considerable detail\" the security guarantees that Ukraine has said would be necessary for it to agree to a cease-fire.  Trump said in his Fox News interview that if he called Zelenskyy for a three-way meeting with himself and Putin, it would be \"very, very important, because that's going to be a meeting where they make a deal.\" He also again alluded to territorial swaps.  \"I don't want to use the word 'divvy things up,' but you know, to a certain extent, it's not a bad term, OK\" he said.  Trump previously said to end the conflict both sides will have to swap land to end intense fighting that has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides and displaced millions of Ukrainians.  But French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump was \"very clear\" in a call on August 13 that he wants to achieve a cease-fire at the summit and that Trump had been clear that \"territorial issues relating to Ukraine...will only be negotiated by the Ukrainian president.\"  \"Trump's thinking is apparently closer aligned with that of the Europeans than first feared by some,\" one European official told RFE/RL after the call.  Trump has warned Russia of \"very severe consequences\" if it doesn't halt its war against Ukraine, but has given no details on what consequences Moscow could face.  If Trump's insistence on involving Ukraine is confirmed, it would help ease fears among Ukraine, but Russia has consistently given the idea of a meeting with Zelenskyy the cold shoulder, suggesting it should only happen once the sides are close to signing a peace deal, not just a cease-fire agreement.  That moment seems far off, given the huge gap between the Russian and Ukrainian positions that persists on several major issues, including territory and security, despite three rounds of direct talks in Turkey since mid-May.

Peace means lower fuel prices for consumers, even as a bearish oil sector turns increasingly pessimistic about the months and year ahead.

The deal is part of a recent streak of U.S. oil purchases following President Trump&rsquo;s threat to impose additional tariffs on Indian exporters to the United States if the country continues buying Russian crude.  The October deal was priced at a premium of between $2.80 and $2.90 to dated Brent, Reuters&rsquo; sources said.  It is price that pushed India to step up Russian oil purchases in the first place, turning Russia from a minor exporter to the subcontinent, into one of its top crude oil suppliers, accounting for about a third of total imports.  India&rsquo;s government reacted negatively to Trump&rsquo;s threat, saying it had no intention of suspending oil imports from Russia, noting that the United States and the European Union were still buying energy commodities from Russia despite a barrage of energy sanctions on the latter.  Yet reports have been coming in about a pivot to U.S. oil as well as oil from other regions. Earlier this month, Indian Oil Corp. bought 2 million barrels of U.S. Mars crude, another 2 million barrels of Brazilian oil, and 1 million barrels of Libyan crude, Reuters sources said last week. These deals follow the securing of 8 million barrels by Indian Oil Corp. from sellers in the Middle East, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria.  Meanwhile, however, Tankers loaded with Russian crude that had stayed idle off India&rsquo;s coast for days discharged their cargo at Indian oil import terminals earlier this month, in defiance of the U.S. threats, Bloomberg reported, with the total discharged at 3 million barrels of Russian Urals, the flagship grade that Russia exports to Asia.  Shunning Russian oil entirely would add an estimated $20 billion to India&rsquo;s oil import bill over a period of two years, according to analyst calculations.

As of 937 a.m. EST on Friday, the U.S. benchmark oil price, WTI Crude, was down by 1.38% at $63.10, as President Trump departed for Anchorage, Alaska, to meet with Putin.  The international benchmark, Brent Crude, traded 1.18% lower at $66.07 per barrel.  The face-to-face meeting between President Trump and Putin is expected to begin around 3 p.m. EST and it's unclear how long it would take.  President Trump on Thursday threatened \"very severe consequences\" for Russia if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire agreement.  The market struggles to anticipate what the outcome of the Trump-Putin meeting will be. Some analysts are concerned that President Trump could agree to Russian terms that could include territorial concession by Ukraine.  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that decisions about Ukraine taken in his absence would be meaningless.  Trump has signaled he would at a later stage work for a meeting that would include Zelenskyy.  According to A/S Global Risk Management's chief analyst Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, the Friday meeting \"is unlikely to deliver significant results.\"  \"If a follow-up meeting is agreed, Trump may seek to place responsibility on Putin and Zelenskiy,\" Rasmussen told Bloomberg.  \"In the near term, new US sanctions are unlikely; a relaxation cannot be ruled out unless the meeting collapses,\" the analyst added.  A relaxation of the U.S. sanctions against Russia could increase concerns about oversupply on the market later this year and early 2026.  \"The geopolitical risk premium tied to the TrumpPutin meeting in Alaska is now a secondary driver, and unless talks break down sharply, the macro drag from the demand outlook may keep a lid on rallies, with Brent potentially struggling above USD 70 per barrel,\" Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a Friday note.

The week was shaped by several high-impact fundamental eventsnone of which proved decisive enough to shift the balance away from oversupply and tepid demand. Traders were focused on Friday's Trump-Putin meeting, but until concrete action disrupts physical flows, the dominant pressure remains rooted in inventories and production.  Trump-Putin Meeting Raises Risk, But Market Demands Proof  The most closely watched event of the week is Friday's planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Trump has threatened \"severe consequences\" should Putin fail to pursue peace in Ukraine, including potential secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian crudeparticularly China and India.  India alone sourced roughly 1.8 million barrels per day from Russia in the first half of the year, amounting to 37% of its total crude imports. Targeting these flows would represent a major shift in global balances, particularly for medium sour grades.  However, the market has shown skepticism. Traders remain unconvinced that Trump will follow through, given past patterns of backing away from aggressive rhetoric. Without formal sanctions or actual export disruptions, the geopolitical risk is being treated as a background factornot a directional force.  IEA and EIA Reports Add to Bearish Pressure  The supply-demand imbalance was reinforced this week by bearish signals from both the International Energy Agency IEA and the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA. The IEA raised its global supply forecast, citing stronger-than-expected output from OPEC and non-OPEC producers. Simultaneously, it trimmed its demand estimate due to persistent weakness in major economies, especially in Europe and Asia.  The EIA's weekly report showed a surprise 3 million barrel build in U.S. crude inventories, compared to expectations for a modest draw. Commercial crude stocks rose to 426.7 million barrels, while net imports surged by nearly 700,000 barrels per day. U.S. exports, meanwhile, declinedreflecting soft global demand for American crude.  Product data was mixed, with gasoline drawing down slightly and distillates increasing. Overall, the figures point to a market that is oversupplied and underdrawn, particularly given that refinery runs remain elevated and seasonal demand is near its peak. The lack of any tightening trend is weighing on sentiment.  Tariff Pause Provides Short-Term Relief but No Resolution  President Trump's decision to delay new tariffs on Chinese goods until November 10 provided temporary relief to global markets. Traders had been bracing for another escalation in trade restrictions, which could have hurt industrial activity and transportation fuel demand.  While the pause has removed immediate downside risk tied to trade policy, it does not suggest an agreement is near. The move was interpreted more as a political calculation than an economic strategy. For crude markets, this means that any demand boost is likely to be modest and temporary unless broader trade flows improve.  Rate Cut Expectations Help But Don't Reverse the Trend  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates in September, following weak U.S. employment data and a moderate inflation reading in July. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added to that speculation by suggesting a 50 basis point move could be warranted. But Thursday's hotter-than-expected PPI data, has taken the \"big\" cut off the table.  Rate cuts typically support crude demand by lowering borrowing costs, stimulating consumption, and weakening the dollar. While this has added a marginal boost to sentiment, the physical crude market remains weighed down by oversupply. Unless easier financial conditions translate into sustained product draws or stronger refinery runs, the impact on pricing will be limited.  OPEC Holds Steady While Non-OPEC Supply Grows  OPEC showed no sign of making new output adjustments this week, as members wait to see how global balances evolve. UBS revised its year-end Brent forecast downward to $62, citing resilient sanctioned exports and growing South American supply.  Guyana, in particular, continues to ramp up faster than expected. An Exxon-led consortium began production at a new offshore vessel four months ahead of schedule, adding barrels to an already saturated market. These barrels are increasingly finding buyers in the Atlantic Basin and adding pressure to traditional West African and Middle Eastern flows.  Saudi Arabia announced a cut in crude exports to China for September, lowering volumes to 1.43 million barrels per day from August's 1.65 million. However, the move coincided with higher official selling prices, which has reduced interest from major Asian refiners. Indian refiners received full Saudi allocations but did not request additional barrelssuggesting demand caution rather than supply constraint.  Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures    Trend Indicator Analysis  The main trend is down, according to the weekly swing chart. This week's trade through $62.69 changed the trend. Taking out $70.51 will change the main trend to up.  The market also crossed to the bearish side of the 52-week moving average at $64.25, which is a sign of weakness. Crude oil is also edging on the weak side of a pair of 50% levels at $64.13 and $65.37, indicating increasing downside pressure.  Weekly Technical Forecast  The direction of the Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures market the week ending August 22 is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $64.25.  Bullish Scenario  A sustained move over $64.25 will signal the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum, we could see a near-term rally through the long-term pivot at $65.37 with all eyes on a return to the swing top at $70.51.  Bearish Scenario  A sustained move under $64.25 will indicate the presence of sellers. This could lead to a quick test of the June low at $62.69. This price is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the downside with $52.00 to $51.00 the next potential targets.  Market Outlook Bearish Bias Unless Supply Disruption Emerges  While this week has introduced event risk from the Trump-Putin summit and central bank speculation, neither has changed the fundamental backdrop. Crude oil markets are well-supplied, global demand remains soft, and inventories are not drawing at a pace consistent with a bullish rebalancing.  Unless the U.S. enacts sanctions that materially reduce Russian exports, or unless next week's EIA data reveals a significant draw, crude is likely to remain under pressure. Traders are watching for signs of tighter physical balances, but so far, the signals continue to point lower.  The most probable outcome is continued range trading with a downward bias. Risk events remain in focus, but they are not enough to counter persistent oversupply.  Technically, trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $64.25 will set the tone.", "analysis": 2}, "275": {"title": "Fears Of An Oil Price Crash On A Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire Overdone", "source": "OilPrice.com", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Fears-Of-An-Oil-Price-Crash-On-A-Russia-Ukraine-Ceasefire-Overdone.html", "date": "2025-08-15T00:00:00+00:00", "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump has, over the past couple of weeks, renewed efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, going as far as proposing the swapping of territories between the two countries. Unlike the situation during the first meeting between Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin earlier in the year, Trump has adopted a far less conciliatory tone ahead of their second meeting in Alaska on August 15th, warning that Russia will face \"very severe consequences\" unless Putin agrees to end the war in Ukraine. However, the White House says it expects the Anchorage summit to be a \"listening exercise,\" downplaying the odds of a peace deal being reached.  Still, the potential of a return of more Russian energy commodities to the markets has depressed oil and gas prices amid expectations that a breakthrough in the negotiations could see sanctions on Russian exports lifted. Brent crude has pulled back from a 2-month high of $72.47 per barrel recorded two weeks ago to $66.72 per barrel in Thursday's intraday session, while WTI crude has declined from $70.00 per barrel to $63.81. However, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that fears that oil prices will crash if Trump manages to negotiate a truce with Putin are overdone. First off, StanChart says that Russia has been producing unsustainably at its maximum capacity with long-term consequences for its reservoirs. The country's oil production averaged 9.01 million barrels per day mb/d in H1-2025, about 610,000 b/d lower than the 2021 annual average before the invasion of Ukraine. A lifting of export sanctions will mean a return of Western service companies and Russia being able to access quality replacement parts; however, Russia just doesn't have a lot of spare production capacity to flood the oil markets.  Related How Canada's Oil Sands Producers Pump More Crude from the Same Assets  Second, Russia might demand the removal of the oil price cap by Western nations as part of the peace deal. However, the analysts have pointed out that the removal of the price cap would eliminate the price advantage for India and China to take Russian crude, currently the biggest buyers of discounted Russian oil. StanChart points out that India has been an opportunistic purchaser of cheaper Russian crude, and could revert to its previous import volumes with dire consequences for Russia. Previously, we reported that India imported goods worth $65.7 billion from Russia in 2024, a sharp rise from $8.25 billion in 2021. India's imports of Russian crude have increased more than 20-fold since the war began, jumping to $52.2 billion in 2024 from just $2.31 billion four years ago. Given the additional efforts Russia has undertaken to evade export sanctions, StanChart has predicted that we are unlikely to see a large increase in Russian supply to the global markets in the near term. JP Morgan echoes StanChart's view, saying that Russia has limited scope to expand its shadow fleet of tankers used to transport its crude.  Finally, Russia might not dramatically increase its crude exports for the simple reason that there might not be a ready market for the commodity. After all, Europe has successfully cut its dependency on Russian oil and gas over the past three years, and the continent is highly unlikely to put itself in such a vulnerable position again, especially after Moscow revealed its willingness to weaponize its energy commodities. In the final analysis, StanChart says that although the market might react to positive ceasefire news by selling off in the near term, this would be sentiment- rather than fundamentally-driven, and any price-dip on headlines would likely be short-lived.  When it comes to natural gas, StanChart notes that market expectations of higher Russian flows have been a key factor capping European gas prices in recent times. European natural gas futures have declined to a 2-week low of 32.5/MWh amid robust supply and easing geopolitical risk. While a ceasefire agreement and the associated removal of sanctions by the U..S and EU could potentially allow more Russian gas into Europe, StanChart expects appetite for Russian gas to be limited given the past weaponization of flows. The commodity experts say that a more likely development would be the return of small flows via Ukraine into Hungary and Slovakia. Finally, StanChart says that it's highly unlikely that the Trump administration would agree to a deal that would disrupt its own LNG sector, with U.S. LNG having largely replaced Russian pipeline gas to Europe.

The fall was less steep than in May and June, however, as reduced supply helped lift margins. Still, output over the first seven months has fallen 3.1% from last year to its weakest level since 2020.Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.Coal output fell 3.8% to just over 380 million tons, marking its first year-on-year decline in over a year, although production for the first seven months was still at record levels.While industrial demand for commodities is in a seasonal lull, the weather was also a factor in lowering production, as scorching temperatures and heavy rains forced mines, factories and building sites to curtail activity up and down the country. The coal hubs of northern China, in particular, were heavily affected by downpours that closed pits and disrupted transport.\u00a0The coal industry is also contending with government inspections targeting mines that produce above permitted levels. Meanwhile, pollution curbs to ensure blue skies for next month\u2019s military parade in Beijing are likely to keep the pressure on steel output, a large proportion of which is clustered around the capital.Thermal coal producers are shielded from swingeing cuts to production due to the country\u2019s reliance on the fuel for power generation, which has spiked over the summer as temperatures have soared. But the steel industry \u2014 and the miners that deliver coking coal for its blast furnaces \u2014 have much less protection.Property Collapse\u00a0The collapse in China\u2019s property market has stripped back a key pillar of demand. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that excess steel capacity last year was 142 million tons, almost four times the level in 2020. A boom in exports has taken up some of the slack, but rising protectionism around the world is likely to cap sales.Among other building materials, both cement and glass production continued to fall sharply. Aluminum output stayed elevated as profits at smelters rose due to the drop in alumina costs.For fossil fuels, refining restarts after maintenance and improved margins saw crude oil processing rise 8.9% year-on-year. Oil and gas output continued to rise in line with the government\u2019s energy security goals.\u00a0\u2014With assistance from Katharine Gemmell, Sarah Chen, Winnie Zhu, Kathy Chen and Martin Ritchie.(Updates to add chart and extra details in final paragraphs)", "analysis": 1}, "279": {"title": "Shell PLC Unsponsored ADR (NYSE:SHEL) Receives $78.64 Average Price Target from Analysts", "source": "ETF Daily News", "link": "https://www.etfdailynews.com/2025/08/15/shell-plc-unsponsored-adr-nyseshel-receives-78-64-average-price-target-from-analysts/", "date": "2025-08-15T05:40:54+00:00", "body": "Shell PLC Unsponsored ADR (NYSE:SHEL \u2013 Get Free Report) has received a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d from the fifteen analysts that are presently  covering the stock, Marketbeat reports.

Some analysts believe his strategy is about more than borders it's a nationalist gambit to consolidate domestic support amid economic pains, while testing whether the U.S. and CARICOM will back their Guyanese partner without hesitating.  The Iraqi federal government in Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government KRG in Erbil have agreed on a framework to resume crude exports through Turkey's Ceyhan terminal, potentially ending months of political deadlock over control, revenue-sharing, and pipeline access. The deal includes provisions for meeting KRG domestic demand around 50,000 bpd with the remainder to be marketed through Iraq's SOMO. While it makes for a good headline, the agreement does not set a date for the restart. Turkey has yet to give formal clearance, and technical checks on the pipeline still need to be completed. For now, consider it a blueprint for an operational restart. Past public statements from Iraqi officials predicting an imminent resumption have failed to materialize, and there are still contractual and logistical issues to resolve before flows can resume.  Beijing's security service is claiming it shut down a smuggling ring run by a foreign intelligence agency to get rare earths out of the country by using false labels, faking origin documents and mixing with everyday goods for routing through third countries. Beijing isn't naming names; instead, it's sending a message that this is being treated not as a trade issue, but as a matter of national security. Smuggling will be considered espionage. This plays into the broader clampdown we've been watching all year. Exports of other controlled minerals like antimony and germanium have collapsed down more than 80% since January because of tighter licensing and more aggressive enforcement. Now they're linking those controls directly to counter-intelligence work.  Discovery &amp; Development  ExxonMobil XOM landed a massive deepwater prize in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, securing acreage bigger than the country itself and eyeing up to $21.7B in potential investment if commercial reserves are found. The initial $42M program will fund 3D seismic and up to two wells, with drilling possible in six months, as Exxon looks to copy-paste its Guyana 11B boe success. Existing infrastructure could fast-track any discovery to market, unlike Guyana's early days, while shared resources between the two countries promise lower costs and faster timelines. PM Kamla Persad signaled fiscal terms will be sweetened to lure more capital, underscoring Port of Spain's determination not to miss out before the global energy window narrows.  Azule Energy, the BPEni JV, is moving to fast-track development of its Capricornus oil find offshore Namibia's Block 2914A, aiming for first oil by 2029 if an FID can be pulled off by late 2026. The company, which took its stake from Rhino Resources last year, hit oil in April and is already weighing development options, with the possibility of taking over operatorship during that phase. Namibia has become one of the industry's hottest new frontiers since TotalEnergies and Shell struck major discoveries three years ago, but recent dry holes and Shell's $400 million writedown have tempered some of the hype. CEO Adriano Mangini says Azule is confident in its reservoir quality and is \"ready to stay in Namibia for many years,\" setting up a race with Rhino and others to be the country's first crude producer.  TotalEnergies is gearing up to drill up to seven wells offshore South Africa in the Deep Western Orange Basin, about 211 km from Saldanha Bay, in a campaign that could start as early as 2026. The basin sits adjacent to Namibia's recent blockbuster finds, and Total is chasing similar geology after scoring big there in 2022. Rival Shell also plans as many as five wells in the Northern Cape Ultra Deep block, having secured environmental approval in June. Both majors face a legal landscape shaped by recent environmental court wins that have stalled other South African offshore projects.  Norway has officially opened its northernmost oil field, Johan Castberg, operated by Equinor 46.3% with partners Vr Energi 30% and Petoro 23.7%. Located in the Barents Sea, the 450600 MMbbl field draws from the Skrugard, Havis, and Drivis discoveries and is expected to produce for 30 years. First oil was achieved on March 31, with output already hitting its 220,000 bpd peak capacity in under three months. Energy Minister Terje Aasland called it a milestone for the region, adding that the Barents now hosts Norway's second-largest producing oil field, second-largest gas field, and its biggest discovery under development.  Petrobras has secured regulatory clearance to conduct emergency response drills in Brazil's Foz do Amazonas basin on Aug. 24, a decisive step toward securing its long-delayed exploration license. The Atlantic acreage, 330 miles from the Amazon River's mouth, is seen as critical to offsetting a national production peak expected around 2030, with Petrobras budgeting $3 billion for the Equatorial Margin campaign. Environmental regulator Ibama has blocked drilling there for over a decade due to spill risks, but the upcoming three-to-four-day pre-operational assessment is considered the final hurdle before an exploration permit. Petrobras says it's ready to spud immediately, eyeing potential Guyana-scale upside after Exxon's multibillion-barrel discoveries to the north.  Libya's NOC has announced a new oil discovery in the Ghadames Basin from the A-65/2 well, operated by Sonatrach subsidiary SIPEX. Initial test flows came in at about 4,200 bpd, confirming commercial potential. The find is part of a broader push by NOC to restart rigs and expand drilling in the basin, with three more wells planned. The discovery adds to Libya's efforts to boost production capacity after years of underinvestment and conflict-related outages.  SBM Offshore's FPSO One Guyana has started production at ExxonMobil's Yellowtail development in the Stabroek block, marking the country's fourth producing FPSO and boosting total installed capacity to over 900,000 bpd. Yellowtail, sanctioned in 2022, is Guyana's largest oil project to date, with six drill centers, up to 26 producers and 25 injectors, and an initial average output of 250,000 bpd. First oil came four months ahead of schedule, with the two-million-barrel-capacity unit joining the Liza Destiny, Liza Unity, and Prosperity FPSOs producing Golden Arrowhead crude. ExxonMobil, with partners Hess Chevron and CNOOC, targets 1.7 million boe/d capacity from eight Guyana developments by 2030.  Deals, Mergers &amp; Acquisitions  Santos has extended the due diligence and exclusivity period for a potential $5.76/share takeover by an ADNOC-led consortium, pushing the deadline to Aug. 22. The groupwhich includes Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co. and Carlylehas \"substantially completed\" its review and found no deal-breaking issues, reaffirming its commitment to a binding agreement. The offer, up from earlier bids of $5.04 and $5.42, would see the consortium acquire all ordinary shares and expand Santos' gas and LNG portfolio to target 2025 mtpa capacity by 2035. Santos, operating in Australia, PNG, Timor-Leste and the U.S., previously scrapped merger talks with Woodside in 2024.  Duke Energy plans to merge its two main North Carolina utilitiesDuke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinasinto a single entity with uniform rates across its service area. The company says the merger, slated for January 2027 pending approval, would generate $1 billion in customer savings through 2038. The move follows the passage of North Carolina's Power Bill Reduction Act, which allows Duke to recover ongoing capital costs and removes the state's 2030 carbon-reduction mandate. Duke expects the consolidation to streamline operations and improve cost efficiency as it ramps up new generation projects.  Energy Earnings  Petrobras posted Q2 net income of 26.7B reais $4.89B, reversing a 2.6B reais loss from the prior year as higher output and cost controls offset weaker crude prices. Daily production topped 2M bpd, while adjusted EBITDA rose 5.1% to 52.3B reais despite Brent averaging $67.82/bbl versus $75.66 in Q1. The company approved 8.66B reais in dividends and interest payments, alongside $1.6B in advance dividends for FY2025. Capex reached $4.4B in the quarterup 30.6% YoYfocused on pre-salt Santos Basin development and new FPSO builds.  Constellation Energy posted Q2 2025 GAAP net income of $2.67/share and adjusted operating earnings of $1.91/share, up from $1.68 a year ago, driven by strong Generation and Commercial business performance. The company secured a 20-year PPA with Meta for the full output of its Clinton Clean Energy Center, received regulatory approvals for its Calpine acquisition, and advanced the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center to 2027. Nuclear fleet output held steady at over 45,000 GWh with a 94.8% capacity factor, while the gas and renewables fleet maintained high dispatch and capture rates.

Trump's billing it as a shot at ending the Ukraine war, but let's keep some perspective he's been saying \"two weeks\" since the campaign trail and has repeated it in office like a mantra. Nothing on the battlefield or in politics has shifted in his favor, yet markets are trading this as if an outcome is baked inand the outcome is expected to be more Russian barrels on the market. It's not likely grounded in much reality, but it's the pull of the optics. The image of Trump and Putin sitting down in Alaska may move markets for a few hours, but both men are walking in with hard, pre-set positions and no appetite for real concessions. The stagecraft will be there; the fundamentals will not change.  Putin is coming in with his usual posture willing to talk, unwilling to give up what he's taken. He's stress-testing the alliance. If he can coax Trump into floating ideas that would readjust NATO's red lines such as recognizing current front lines, rolling back some sanctions without a withdrawal, and slowing Ukraine's NATO path, he'll be watching how Europe reacts. Do Berlin, Paris, Warsaw, and London close ranks immediately, or does anyone hedge their language, drag their feet There is also high-level PR value here. Just being in Anchorage after years of isolation is a win he can take home and sell. It's proof, in his narrative, that Washington has to meet him on equal terms.  Trump has floated the idea of a follow-up with Zelenskyy, but for now, Ukraine's out of the room, and European capitals aren't thrilled. As for the chatter about Trump giving Russia access to Alaskan natural resources in the Bering Strait, that's media fantasy. It's hard to imagine a scenario where Washington hands over domestic asset rights to beg Putin to end the war. Trump's image would never survive such a thing, and there is no clear incentive to back up this speculation.  No serious observers will expect a major breakthrough today. This is theater, and in that sense, it serves both men. But by letting the expectations balloon, the White House is setting itself up for market and political whiplash depending on the level of theater.  In the meantime, there have been some peace developments in a different theater Armenia and Azerbaijan.  Yerevan and Baku have put their names to a U.S.-brokered peace accord that recognizes each other's borders, renounces force, and greenlights a transit corridor across southern Armenia linking Azerbaijan proper to Nakhchivan and on to Turkey. The route stays under Armenian jurisdiction, but Washington gets exclusive development rights commercial, not military and will subcontract the build-out. That's the core. Everything else is positioned around it. The narrative has since been focused on Moscow and Tehran. Russia has offered the polite \"welcome\" while warning against \"foreign meddling,\" its way of keeping the door open for a Russian role in monitoring or customs. Iran's line is harder public threats to block the corridor, framing it as a U.S. foothold on its northern border, and pushing back on talk of any 99-year arrangement. Armenian envoys are already telling Tehran there will be no foreign security presence, but that won't stop Iran from testing the limits with military drills along the Aras, bureaucratic interference, or prodding Armenian opposition to slow ratification. On the Azerbaijani side, there's a built-in brake. Baku wants Armenia to amend the constitutional language it sees as implying territorial claims; Yerevan hasn't delivered, and doing so quickly is politically costly. That gives Aliyev an easy excuse to pace the corridor's rollout.", "analysis": 1}, "288": {"title": "Europe on Edge Ahead of Trump-Putin Meeting", "source": "OilPrice.com", "link": "https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Europe-on-Edge-Ahead-of-Trump-Putin-Meeting.html", "date": "2025-08-15T15:00:00+00:00", "body": "As Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump prepare to meet in Alaska for a high-stakes summit to discuss ending the 43-month-old war in Ukraine, a deep feeling of unease is gripping European capitals, especially Kyiv.  The August 15 meeting between the two leaders, their first since Trump returned to the presidency in January, could reshape not only Ukraine's future borders but also European security without either Kyiv or Brussels having a say.  Trump has made ending the conflict -- Europe's largest since World War II -- a top foreign policy priority. Confident in his deal-making skills and friendly relationship with Putin, Trump believes that goal can be achieved starting with the one-to-one meeting announced only a week ago.  Since then, Western officials and experts have expressed concern that Trump, who eschews traditional diplomatic procedures in favor of deal-making, will be outwitted by Putin, who has more than a quarter-century of experience negotiating with Western leaders.  When he told reporters that he and Putin would discuss the possibility of land swaps between Russia and Ukraine, the anxiety level rose over fears that he could recognize the Kremlin's land grab, appeasing the aggressor.  The surprise announcement of the summit sent Ukrainian and European leaders scrambling to get face time with Trump. While European leaders expressed a sigh of relief following a conference call with Trump on August 13, what the 79-year-old US leader will agree to in Alaska is anyone's guess, experts said.  \"I think it's really worth noting how remarkable it is that there is such a high degree of uncertainty of what's going to come out of this meeting,\" said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, senior fellow and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security CNAS.  \"It has been exceptionally difficult to gauge what President Trump's views on Ukraine are, in large part because there have been flip flops and U-turns, and it has been inconsistent from start to finish,\" she said on August 14 in a conference call with reporters.  Trump, who has expressed admiration for Putin over the years, tore into Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February during a meeting in the Oval Office that shocked the Western world.  A few months later, Trump was focusing his ire on Putin for not agreeing to his demand for a 30-day cease-fire. Despite his rhetoric and threats of sanctions, Trump hasn't imposed any penalties on Russia to date. Kendall-Taylor said that is a sign that Trump's affinity is still with Russia and Putin.  On the eve of the summit, Trump continued to keep everyone guessing about its outcome. As he played down the chances for any breakthrough in Alaska, Trump told Fox News that Putin's \"going to make a deal.\"  He also told Fox News that he might be willing to stay in Alaska for a three-way meeting, including Zelenskyy, if he makes progress with the Russian leader.  Zelenskyy on August 14 was in in London to discuss security with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a show of British support. He and other European leaders want to ensure their interests are taken into account when Trump and Putin meet.  In Moscow, Putin praised Trump's efforts to end the war in a short video released by the Kremlin, saying the White House is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities\" and to \"reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved.\"  But there is plenty of skepticism about Putin's true intentions to match the high degree of anxiety in Ukraine.  \"Already the fact that this meeting is happening is not playing in Ukraine's favor,\" said Olga Tokariuk, a fellow with the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis CEPA.  The opposite is true for Russia \"because it legitimizes Putin,\" Tokariuk said, speaking during a conference call on August 14. \"He gets a meeting with the US president on the US soil without any concessions on his side.\"  The worst-case scenario would be if Ukraine is forced to make some territorial concessions without any security guarantees in return, said Tokariuk. Ukraine worries that this would only lead to renewed Russian aggression within a couple of months.  \"If there is no accountability for Russia for having started this full-scale war in 2022 that will just encourage Russia to come back for more,\" Tokariuk said.  Kendall-Taylor said that one risk for Ukraine is that Putin might be able to \"reframe\" Trump's view of Zelenskyy as the barrier to ending the war.  The danger is that if Putin talks about his genuine desire to end the war and makes some \"reasonable looking proposals that Ukraine will have to reject,\" Zelenskyy could find himself back in Trump's crosshairs as the obstinate and uncompromising figure,\" said Kendall-Taylor, who served as deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the US National Intelligence Council from 2015-2018.  There is also skepticism that threatening Putin with tariffs is enough to curb his territorial ambitions. Trump will have to be forceful, said Richard Haas, a former high-ranking State Department official who helped negotiate peace deals on behalf of the United States under previous administrations.  \"If you really want to change Putin's calculus you've got to disabuse Putin of one notion that time is on his side, [and] that by continuing this war Russia will gradually grind and grind and grind and get what it wants,\" Haas said in an interview with US broadcaster CBS. \"All President Trump has to do is say, 'Vlad, ain't gonna happen.'\"  The talks come at a pivotal moment, with Trump increasingly frustrated with Putin and the Russian president showing no signs of bending on the Kremlin's maximalist demands. Trump and Putin have held six phone calls, and the White House's lead envoy has traveled to Moscow at least three times.  Zelenskyy said he and Starmer discussed \"in considerable detail\" the security guarantees that Ukraine has said would be necessary for it to agree to a cease-fire.  Trump said in his Fox News interview that if he called Zelenskyy for a three-way meeting with himself and Putin, it would be \"very, very important, because that's going to be a meeting where they make a deal.\" He also again alluded to territorial swaps.  \"I don't want to use the word 'divvy things up,' but you know, to a certain extent, it's not a bad term, OK\" he said.  Trump previously said to end the conflict both sides will have to swap land to end intense fighting that has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides and displaced millions of Ukrainians.  But French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump was \"very clear\" in a call on August 13 that he wants to achieve a cease-fire at the summit and that Trump had been clear that \"territorial issues relating to Ukraine...will only be negotiated by the Ukrainian president.\"  \"Trump's thinking is apparently closer aligned with that of the Europeans than first feared by some,\" one European official told RFE/RL after the call.  Trump has warned Russia of \"very severe consequences\" if it doesn't halt its war against Ukraine, but has given no details on what consequences Moscow could face.  If Trump's insistence on involving Ukraine is confirmed, it would help ease fears among Ukraine, but Russia has consistently given the idea of a meeting with Zelenskyy the cold shoulder, suggesting it should only happen once the sides are close to signing a peace deal, not just a cease-fire agreement.  That moment seems far off, given the huge gap between the Russian and Ukrainian positions that persists on several major issues, including territory and security, despite three rounds of direct talks in Turkey since mid-May.

The company faces multiple challenges this year, including reduced gasoline and diesel production due to the rapid spread of electric vehicles and intense competition within the industry.Despite these challenges, Sinopec anticipates growth in demand for natural gas and chemical products in China during H2.However, refined oil products are expected to continue facing competition from alternative energy sources.The company is aiming for oil processing of 130 million tonnes (mt) for the second six months, up from 120mt in H1.Globally, the average price of crude benchmark Brent was around $71 a barrel (bbl) during this period, down from $83/bbl last year.This decrease in import prices has led to a reduction in the value of inventories but has also eased feedstock costs.Sinopec's drilling activities have remained stable, in line with Beijing's goal of ensuring energy security.The company's refining unit saw profits fall to 2.6bn yuan from 6.4bn yuan last year, while its chemical operations reported a loss of 4.5bn yuan, compared to 3.6bn yuan the previous year.The upstream drilling division reported a 21bn yuan profit, a decrease from the 26.8bn yuan earned last year.Additionally, the marketing and distribution unit faced pressure from lower prices, with profits dropping to 7.2bn yuan.In a separate development, Sinopec announced in May 2025 that its Tiebei 1HF well at Project Deep Earth \u2013 Sichuan and Chongqing Natural Gas Base had achieved a vertical depth of more than 5,300m.\"Sinopec H1 profit slumps amid market challenges\" was originally created and published by Offshore Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\u00a0The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.
