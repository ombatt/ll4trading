Let's review the intraday price action after the uh pop near the opening bell really didn't do much except drift a slightly higher all day long. There's a Dow up uh 616 points to end the day. And here's the Nasdaq, a little bit less than that, 71 basis points or 7/10ths of a percent. And the S&P 500, a little bit higher than that, but very similar charts among the three.And the S&P 600 up over 2%. So the small caps flying high today. And by the way, this is the best day for most of these indices going back to, I believe, August 12th. So, don't quote me on that, but it's been a few weeks since we've seen moves like this. And let's just skip over to the heat maps that we have. We're going to check out the sector action. Energy kind of spoiled the party here down a whopping one basis point. Everything else closed in the green.XLB is in the upper left, that's materials, that was up 2.06%. Followed by consumer discretionary thanks to Tesla. Then you got health care, financials, real estate, communication services, all of those up more than 1 and a half percent. And if we break down the Nasdaq 100, take a peek inside. You can see the mega caps actually split here. We got some weakness in Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Broadcom. Broadcom down 2 and a half percent.but that didn't disrupt the party. We got big moves from Apple up almost 1 and a half percent, and as I said, Tesla up 6%. Also notable is Micron up 7 and a half percent. Taking a look at the Dow Industrials, Boeing is a standout that was down 3% to the 3% to the downside. But other than that, pretty nice day all around three uh 3M up almost 4%, Sherwin Williams up over three, Home Depot up over two and United Health nearly two.And I don't punch up the transports very often, but check this out. Only Delta Airlines in the red today. Aside from that, we got some standouts from CSX, that's up two and a half percent, and JB Hunt up 3%. It was a really kind of broad-based. I'm going to go for the meme stocks one more time because we really had some huge days for Open. Open door up 80%, Circle up 17%, BuzzFeed up 9%. So, a lot of risk on today, not to mention. I didn't even get to the IPO of the day figure, but that was up too.All right, thank you Jared. And Inez, over to you. Taking a look at commodities, oil prices feeling the pressure. Tell us more.Yeah, and that's because of over supply worries. You have the IEA, the International Energy Agency which said that world uh oil supply hit a record in August and the agency is saying that there will be uh supply uh going faster, uh growing faster this year and also going into 2026. So what the IEA is now anticipating is a supply of 2.7 million barrels per day, a rise of 2.7 million barrels per day. That's up from 2.5 million that they had forecast previously.Also, the agency is expecting global supply to be at around roughly 4 million barrels per day in the first half of 2026. So that's some of the pressure that you are seeing with oil prices. Now, oil prices had started the morning lower anyways and that is because of inventory numbers in the US that came in higher than expected. But look, a lot of this over supply worry is because OPEC Plus has been increasing production.and you also have non OPEC members that have been also increasing production as well. So, year to date, rent is down about 10%. You've got WTI that's down about 12% year to date. That doesn't change the thesis from Wall Street. They're expecting oil prices to end the year a bit lower than what we're seeing right now and for them to continue to go lower in 2026.", "analysis": 2}, "2": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil prices extend losses on oversupply, US demand concerns", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-extend-losses-oversupply-012644987.html", "date": "2025-09-12T01:26:44.000Z", "body": "By Sam Li and Lewis Jackson(Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday, extending the previous session's hefty losses as concerns about oversupply and weaker U.S. demand outweighed worries about the risk of supply disruption from conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine.Brent crude futures fell 55 cents, or 0.83%, to $65.82 a barrel by 0703 GMT, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 57 cents, or 0.91%, to $61.80.\"The (U.S.) inflation battle doesn't quite look won, which dampens the demand outlook for oil from the world's largest economy,\" said Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at brokerage Phillip Nova.\"Even geopolitical unrest is failing to support oil prices, as fundamentals point to an oversupply and lacklustre demand,\" Sachdeva added.Government reports on Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices in August increased by the most in seven months and a surge in first-time applications for unemployment aid last week.The data fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week to try and boost economic growth, which would in turn drive up demand for oil.Oil prices had gained as much as 2% earlier this week on the potential for disruptions to output or trade flows from conflicts, but the benchmarks started tumbling on Thursday - wiping out those gains.The slide began after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a monthly report that world oil supply would rise more rapidly than expected this year due to planned output increases by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+.OPEC, in its own report, made no change to its relatively high global oil demand growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026, saying the world economy was maintaining a solid growth trend.The crude market keeps toggling between surplus supply pressures and concerns about short-term disruptions, but the geopolitical worries are providing diminishing support to prices, SDIC Futures said in a daily report.OPEC+ decided on Sunday to further raise its oil output quotas from October as the group's leader, Saudi Arabia, pushes to regain market share.Saudi Arabia's crude oil exports to China are set to surge, several trade sources told Reuters on Thursday, with state-controlled energy firm Aramco shipping about 1.65 million barrels per day that way in October, up sharply from 1.43 million bpd allocated in September.In Russia, the world's second-biggest producer of crude behind the U.S. in 2024, revenue from crude and oil products sales declined in August to one of the lowest levels seen since the start of the war in Ukraine, the IEA said.", "analysis": 2}, "3": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil Falls Amid Softening U.S. Demand", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/bc119c61-dcd3-34b6-a3c2-e812773acd85/oil-falls-amid-softening-u-s-.html", "date": "2025-09-12T00:29:00.000Z", "body": "OIL MARKETS 0026 GMT \u2014 Oil prices fall in the Asian session, fueled by mounting evidence of softening demand in the U.S. The country\u2019s crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 3.9 million barrels last week, which signals weaker-than-expected summer demand and contributing to oversupply concerns, says Sky Links Capital Group\u2019s Daniel Takieddine in a commentary.", "analysis": 2}, "4": {"type": "news", "title": "Big Oil Warns About A Looming LNG Supply Glut", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-warns-looming-lng-000000214.html", "date": "2025-09-12T00:00:00.000Z", "body": "Lately, Wall Street has been warning that oil markets could soon face a surplus, putting more pressure on already depressed oil prices. To wit, Goldman Sachs has predicted that oil markets could be oversupplied by 1.9 million b/d in 2026 amid OPEC+ unwinding production cuts and production in the Americas rising. Wall Street now sees oil prices sinking to the $50s per barrel next year, further compounding a $15/barrel decline in the current year.And now the experts are telling energy bulls to expect even more misery, with LNG markets headed for a glut in the coming years. TotalEnergies\u2019 (NYSE:TTE) CEO Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 has warned of a looming LNG supply glut in the United States, shortly after Texas-based NextDecade Corp. (NASDAQ:NEXT) announced it has made a positive final investment decision (FID) on Train 4 at its Rio Grande LNG liquefaction plant with a planned total capacity of 48 million tonnes per annum (mpta).Pouyann\u00e9 says the U.S. is building too many LNG plants, which could trigger a long-lasting glut if the projects come online as planned. Pouyann\u00e9 might have a valid concern. Rio Grande\u2019s Train 4 has LNG production capacity of ~6 mpta, bringing the plant\u2019s total capacity under construction to 24 mpta. Meanwhile, NextDecade has revealed that Train 5 is nearing a positive FID while Trains 6-8 are currently in the development and permitting process. Project costs for Train 4 are expected to total ~$6.7 billion, financed with 40% equity and 60% debt. TotalEnergies holds a 10% stake in Rio Grande LNG.Related: Israeli Surprise Strike on Qatar Sends Oil Prices HigherInterestingly, NextDecade shares tanked 18.6% after the development hit news feeds. This can largely be attributed to the expected share dilution associated with Rio Grande LNG development as well as the large increase in debt load. Currently, NextDecade has a market cap of $2.1 billion and long-term debt of $2.5 billion.NextDecade shareholders could also share Pouyann\u00e9\u2019s oversupply jitters:\u00a0 Previously, we reported that Venture Global (NYSE:VG) commenced LNG production at its Plaquemines LNG plant in December 2024. Production began just 30 months after the final investment decision (FID) was made, making the plant with a 20 mtpa nameplate capacity one of the two fastest greenfield projects to reach first production. Once fully operational, Plaquemines will be among the largest LNG facilities in the world, featuring 36 electrically-driven 0.626 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) liquefaction trains, configured in eighteen blocks.", "analysis": 1}, "5": {"type": "news", "title": "BlackRock, Global Banks Back Aramco\u2019s Giant Gas Play", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-global-banks-back-aramco-230000591.html", "date": "2025-09-11T23:00:00.000Z", "body": "Investors in Saudi Aramco\u2019s Jafurah natural gas project have approached a group of lenders to secure $10.3 billion in funding for the project. Jafurah is at the center of Saudi Arabia\u2019s plans to develop its natural gas resources, diversifying from crude oil.With a price tag of a total $100 billion, the Jafurah development is described as the largest unconventional gas development outside the United States. Its reserves are estimated at some 229 trillion cu ft of natural gas plus 75 billion barrels of condensate. Production has been scheduled to start in the current quarter.According to Reuters, BlackRock, via Global Infrastructure Partners, is in talks with potential lenders interested in funding the project. These include JP Morgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, unnamed sources in the know told the publication. The source said BlackRock will contribute $1.8 billion of its own money to the total. According to Bloomberg, which also cited unnamed sources, the funding has already been secured.Per the Bloomberg sources, the funding package consists of a seven-year loan that could be refinanced on the bond market and a 19-year loan facility. In addition to the abovementioned banks, the banks involved in the loans also include Citi, Mitsubishi UFJ, and Mizuho.The news of the loan deal comes a month after Aramco sealed a deal with Blackrock\u2019s Global Infrastructure Partners to invest $11 billion in a lease deal for Jafurah. Under the agreement, the BlackRock-led group will lease midstream facilities that serve Jafurah and then lease them back to Aramco for 20 years. The two set up a subsidiary company to manage the midstream facilities that BlackRock will lease, in which Aramco got 51% and BlackRock got 49%.Earlier in the year, Aramco also announced the signing of a slew of contracts for the Phase 2 development of Jafurah. The contracts\u2019 total value was $12.4 billion, to involve the construction of gas compression facilities and associated pipelines, expansion of the Jafurah Gas Plant\u2014including the construction of gas processing trains\u2014and utilities, sulfur, and export facilities.Another $8.8 billion worth of contractual work was awarded to companies that will expand the project\u2019s Master Gas System to boost its total capacity by an additional 3.15 billion standard cubic feet per day by 2028 through the installation of around 4,000 km (2,485 miles) of pipelines and 17 new gas compression trains.The billions have been piling up as Aramco moves the project closer to commercial production.

Gunvor\u2019s head of research Frederic Lasserre put the pace of recent additions closer to 200,000 barrels a day.China\u2019s crude reserves remain one of the country\u2019s most closely guarded secrets, with little transparency on volumes or the precise scale of stockpiling. Much of the oil is also thought to come from sanctioned producers such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela, further obscuring the flows.Despite the buying spree, Goldman continues to expect Brent crude to slide into the mid-$50s a barrel next year, citing an oversupplied market.The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Thursday forecast that a record surplus in 2026 will be larger than previously anticipated as OPEC+ and others expand output.Output is projected to expand by 2.7 million barrels per day in 2025, up from an earlier estimate of 2.5 million, followed by an additional 2.1 million barrels a day in 2026.The increase comes as OPEC and its allies accelerate the unwinding of production cuts, adding more barrels to the market and intensifying concerns over a surplus that has already pressured prices this year.While demand is also growing, the IEA sees it lagging supply. The agency nudged up its 2025 forecast to 740,000 barrels per day, citing stronger consumption in advanced economies, but still expects global appetite to trail behind.The IEA\u2019s outlook remains more cautious than OPEC\u2019s, reflecting its assumption of a quicker transition toward renewable energy.Also on Thursday, OPEC reaffirmed its view that demand will grow by 1.29 million barrels a day this year, nearly twice the pace projected by the IEA, and said the world economy remains on solid footing heading into the second half of 2025.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

(+1.66%), and October RBOB gasoline (RBV25) closed up +0.0155 (+0.78%).Crude oil and gasoline prices settled higher due to an escalation of geopolitical risks in Europe after Poland shot down drones that crossed into its territory during Russia's latest air strike on Ukraine, calling it an \"act of aggression.\" \u00a0Crude prices rose on Wednesday despite a bearish EIA inventory report that showed weekly crude supplies unexpectedly expanded and gasoline stockpiles rose more than expected. \u00a0Escalation of geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East is bullish for crude prices. \u00a0Geopolitical tensions in Europe escalated today after Poland shot down Russian drones that crossed into its territory in Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine. \u00a0Also, Israel on Tuesday launched a strike on Doha, Qatar, targeting the senior leadership of Hamas. \u00a0Qatar said the attack by Israel violated international law and threatens to widen the conflict in the Middle East, the source of about one-third of global oil supplies.Crude prices also have support after OPEC+ agreed on Sunday to raise its crude production by 137,000 bpd, starting in October. \u00a0This is less than the 547,000 bpd increase the group decided to boost output in September and August. \u00a0OPEC+ also said restarting the remainder of the 1.66 million bpd crude production it had idled will be contingent on \"evolving market conditions.\"Reduced Russian crude output is tightening global oil supplies and is supportive of prices. \u00a0Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries have curbed Russia's crude-processing runs to 5.09 million bpd in the first 27 days of August, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25 years. \u00a0Crude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. \u00a0President Trump on Tuesday told EU officials he's willing to slap new tariffs on India and China, the top importers of Russian crude, in an effort to get Russia to end the war in Ukraine, but only if EU nations do so as well. \u00a0A bearish factor for crude was Monday's action by Saudi Arabia to cut prices for all of its crude grades today by $1 a barrel for buyers in Asia for delivery in October, a sign of weak demand for crude and a steeper cut than expectations of a -50 cents per barrel reduction. \u00a0An increase in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bearish for oil prices. \u00a0Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days rose by +6.8% w/w to 77.69 million bbl in the week ended September 5.Concerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices as OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. \u00a0OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of production capacity that is due to remain offline until late 2026. \u00a0OPEC Aug crude production rose by +400,000 bpd to 28.55 million bpd, the highest in over two years.Wednesday's weekly EIA report was bearish for crude and products. \u00a0EIA crude inventories unexpectedly rose +3.94 million bbl versus expectations of a -1.4 million bbl draw. \u00a0Also, EIA gasoline supplies rose by +1.5 million bbl, above expectations of +500,000 bbl. \u00a0In addition, EIA distillate stockpiles rose +4.7 million bbl to an 8-month high, well above expectations of a +24,000 bbl build. \u00a0On the positive side, crude supplies at Cushing, the delivery point of WTI futures, fell by -365,000 bbl.Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of September 5 were -3.2% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.6% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -10.4% below the 5-year seasonal average. \u00a0US crude oil production in the week ending September 5 rose by +0.5% w/w to 13.495 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12/6/2024.Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending September 5 rose by +2 to 414 rigs, just above the 4-year low of 410 rigs from August 1. \u00a0Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year

Sellers remain in control, and further weakness is likely before the session concludes. The decline triggered a small bear flag breakdown, following last week\u2019s larger flag failure, underscoring the fractal nature of current market pressure. Thursday marks the fifth consecutive rejection at the 20-Day line, highlighting the persistence of resistance and pointing to lower targets.The latest breakdown extends a sharp three-day slide, confirming aggressive selling pressure. Support at the recent $61.84 swing low is now vulnerable, with the next zone anchored by the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement at $60.66. This level is reinforced by a prior May support shelf. A measured move from the current bear flag identifies a target near $59.68, slightly below Fibonacci support, and now in focus for traders watching downside continuation.Despite the downside extension, the current decline remains within a developing falling potential bull wedge pattern. The wedge has already expanded once, with the upper boundary adjusted to connect the $66.52 swing high, which also aligned with resistance at the 50-Day moving average. This adjustment adds credibility to the revised wedge structure and raises the probability that the lower boundary may eventually be tested before the decline completes. Although not guaranteed, such a move would fit the evolving wedge framework.With only one trading day remaining in the week, crude oil appears set to close with a bearish candle if selling persists. Currently, an inside-week shooting star has formed, with prices holding near the lower end of the weekly range. This structure reinforces the short-term bearish tone and highlights the importance of upcoming support tests around $61.84 and $60.66 for the broader trend outlook. It also follows a bearish candle pattern from last week.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar.

You could, at least in theory, come up with the idea that we are in the midst of trying to form a little bit of a double bottom right at the $62 level. This is an area that\u2019s been important in the past as a fulcrum for price, so it does make a certain amount of sense.Any rally at this point in time, I think, is probably short-lived, and we already are trying to do that. The 50-day EMA is currently at the $64.48 level and dropping. I think that does offer a little bit of resistance. Anything above there, then opens up the possibility of the $66 level being targeted. If we were to break down below the $62 level, then it is possible we go looking at the $60 level.The Brent market continues to travel in the same pattern that it has for several weeks as we are pulling back from the 50-day EMA yet again. All things being equal, this is a market that I think is trying to get back down to the $65 level, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that plays out. If we were to break above the 50-day EMA, then it could open up and move toward the $70 level, which of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, an area that has been resistant and an area that is now attracting the 200 day EMA. It\u2019s difficult to imagine that oil is ready to break out anytime soon.

The market gave back Wednesday\u2019s conflict-driven gains, as traders shifted focus back to fundamentals.Brent crude\u00a0slipped 63 cents, or 0.9%, to $66.86 a barrel by midday in London, while WTI crude dropped 68 cents, or 1.1%, to $62.99. The previous session\u2019s rally\u2014fueled by Israel\u2019s strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar and NATO\u2019s interception of Russian drones over Poland\u2014proved short-lived as oversupply headlines dominated trading desks.The International Energy Agency warned Thursday that global oil supply is expected to rise faster than demand, citing increased production from OPEC+ and non-OPEC sources. OPEC+, which agreed Sunday to ramp up output starting in October, appears to be driving the imbalance. The IEA\u2019s call confirms what many traders already suspect\u2014supply is running ahead of consumption growth.Saudi Arabia, the bloc\u2019s largest producer, is aggressively targeting China with cut-price barrels. October exports are projected at 1.65 million bpd, up sharply from September\u2019s 1.43 million bpd. This increase in physical flows underscores the group\u2019s intent to hold market share, even at the risk of adding pressure to already soft prices.Latest EIA data revealed a surprise build of 3.9 million barrels in U.S. crude inventories\u00a0for the week ending September 5. Traders had anticipated a draw of around 1 million barrels. The bearish stock data, coupled with signs of weakening fuel demand, reinforces the view that the U.S. market is oversupplied.Meanwhile, Federal Reserve policy remains a wildcard. Expectations for a rate cut next week are already priced in, but traders are closely watching the U.S. inflation print due Thursday. A stronger-than-expected CPI could disrupt the bond rally and send crude lower on a stronger dollar.Technically, WTI crude remains range-bound below key moving averages. Price action is clustered around the 200-day moving average at $63.32, and upside momentum is unlikely to build without a firm break above the 50-day at $64.40. This setup suggests a market still lacking conviction.While geopolitical risks in the Middle East and Eastern Europe continue to provide short-term support, the broader crude oil outlook remains bearish. Rising OPEC+ output, swelling U.S. inventories, and lackluster demand are keeping a lid on rallies. Until supply tightens or demand surprises to the upside, traders should expect continued pressure on prices.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Poland downed Russian drones in its airspace, sparking NATO concerns. Meanwhile, Israel struck Hamas leaders in Doha, increasing tensions in the Middle East. These events raised fears of potential supply disruptions, supporting oil prices.The U.S. urged the EU to impose 100% tariffs on China and India, both major buyers of Russian oil. The move aims to pressure Moscow into entering peace talks. EU leaders also signalled a faster phase-out of Russian energy. However, markets remain sceptical about actual supply disruptions. Without direct interruptions, geopolitical risk premiums may fade quickly.Despite the geopolitical rally, oil gains were capped. U.S. crude inventories increased by 3.9 million barrels last week. Gasoline and distillate stocks also increased significantly. This unexpected build signals weak near-term demand.The market now expects the Fed to cut rates in September. Upcoming inflation data will likely reinforce these expectations. Lower rates could support economic growth and boost oil demand. However, concerns remain about gasoline usage after the summer driving season. If demand drops sharply, oil prices may struggle to hold gains. For now, oil trades between supply concerns and geopolitical risks.The daily chart for WTI crude oil shows that the price has been consolidating within the long-term support band between the $60-$64 region. This support is further reinforced by an ascending channel pattern, with prices rebounding toward the 50-day SMA at $65.30.As long as the price remains below the 200-day SMA near the $67 level, the outlook for oil prices remains negative. A break below $60 would likely extend the downside move toward $55.50, and a drop below $55.50 could trigger a deeper sell-off in oil prices.On the upside, the key resistance lies at $77. A decisive break above this level would likely initiate a strong bullish move in oil prices.The 4-hour chart for WTI crude oil shows that the price has been trading below the red dotted trendline, indicating bearish price action. Strong resistance remains at the $65.50 level. A break above $65.50 could trigger a move toward the $70 region. On the downside, a break below $60 is needed to confirm further weakness in oil prices.The daily chart for natural gas shows that strong resistance has formed at the 50-day SMA near $3.20. This resistance may lead to a short-term correction in prices. However, a break above $3.20 could trigger a strong move toward the 200-day SMA at $3.50. On the downside, a break below $2.60 is needed to confirm further weakness. As long as the $2.60 support holds, the price may continue to move higher.The 4-hour chart for natural gas shows that the price has formed strong support at the $2.60 level and is facing resistance in the $3.20\u2013$3.40 zone. If the $2.90 support holds and the price breaks above $3.20, it will complete a mini inverted head and shoulders pattern on the technical chart. This breakout could trigger a strong move toward the $3.60 to $4.00 region in natural gas prices.The daily chart for the U.S. Dollar Index shows that the price has broken below the bear flag pattern near the 97.80 level. After the breakdown, the index rebounded toward this key level but remains weak ahead of the upcoming inflation data.The release of inflation figures will likely determine the next move in the Dollar Index and commodity prices. Meanwhile, the RSI remains below the 50 level, indicating continued bearish pressure and a likely move lower.The 4-hour chart for the U.S. Dollar Index shows that the index has been consolidating between the 97.20 and 98.60 levels for the past month. This extended consolidation around the key zone is adding to the bearish pressure.The downside bias remains intact as the index has failed to break above the 100.50 resistance. If upcoming inflation data pushes the index above 100.50, it may ease the short-term bearish pressure. However, a break below 96.50 would confirm a renewed downside move.Muhammad Umair is a finance MBA and engineering PhD.

This confirms short-term bullish control, with the next upside targets now shifting toward $64.40 and $66.18.Momentum indicators show rising strength, and with volume holding steady, traders will be watching for a sustained move toward the $68.70 zone if follow-through continues.Fundamentally, the rally came amid heightened geopolitical tension after Poland intercepted Russian drones and Israel conducted airstrikes in Qatar. While these headlines generated a near-2% jump in crude early Wednesday, the lack of actual supply disruption kept gains limited. Analysts at SEB noted that without real supply risk, geopolitical premiums tend to fade quickly\u2014evidenced by Brent\u2019s retracement from last week\u2019s highs.Bearish pressure also stems from inventory data. The EIA reported a crude build of 3.9 million barrels, well above consensus expectations for a draw. Gasoline stocks rose 1.5 million barrels and distillates jumped 4.7 million, reinforcing concerns of soft post-summer demand. With OPEC+ output rising, and U.S. production holding strong, the oversupply narrative remains intact even as WTI pushes higher technically.Brent crude settled higher on Wednesday, but the chart shows the contract remains capped beneath significant technical resistance. Prices closed at $67.29, with the 50-day moving average at $67.70 providing immediate pressure. Just overhead, the 200-day moving average at $69.79 represents the more decisive barrier, reinforced by the early September swing high at $69.33.The downside has recently been tested, with Brent finding support at $64.92 earlier this month after bouncing off the prior low at $64.73. That double floor offers a clear line of defense for bulls, but momentum is still weak.To shift sentiment, Brent would need to reclaim $69.79 on a daily close; failure to do so leaves the market vulnerable to another retest of support. But the first step in the recovery process is overtaking the 50-day moving average at $67.70.Upside potential remains contained unless Brent clears the $72.74 level from early August. Beyond that, the $77.77 peak remains the more distant bullish target. Until those levels are challenged, traders are likely to treat rallies as selling opportunities, particularly in light of the heavy supply narrative.Natural gas futures fell sharply, with the chart showing a breakdown toward $2.90 support on rising volume. October contracts failed to hold above $3.00, and price is now approaching key support at $2.887.A daily close below that level could trigger further selling toward $2.65.

That being said, the market is likely to continue to see the $66 level above as a massive resistance barrier and the $62 level as a massive support level.I think ultimately, we\u2019re just somewhat stuck in this range. That being said, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been gradually getting bigger. So that is going to take some buying pressure out of the market. The EIA report comes out a little later, so pay attention to that.Brent also has rallied a bit during the trading session on Wednesday to show signs of life again as we threaten the 50-day EMA. That being said, the market is still very much in a range here as well, with $70 on the top offering resistance and $65 on the bottom offering support. The 50 day EMA is flat and again, we have a problem with overproduction.Russia, OPEC and the United States are all just drilling at full speed.

While tensions are elevated, traders noted the absence of any immediate supply disruptions.Despite the headlines, the rally failed to gain momentum. Analysts at SEB warned that \u201cthe dark cloud of surplus ahead\u201d continues to pressure the market, highlighting Brent\u2019s $2 drop from last Tuesday as evidence that geopolitical risk premiums are short-lived without a direct threat to supply.Adding to the political backdrop, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly urged the EU to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese and Indian imports. Both countries are major buyers of Russian oil, and any disruption to their access could have knock-on effects across global oil flows. However, aggressive sanctions risk clashing with inflation concerns and may complicate the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate decision.Traders continue to anticipate a Fed rate cut at the September 16-17 meeting\u2014a move that would likely stimulate economic activity and oil demand.

The failure at that level shifted intraday control back to sellers, leading to a pullback that pushed prices to fall below the midpoint of the day\u2019s trading range.

It marks the second test of that average since it failed as support last Thursday, a day that confirmed the breakdown from a bear flag formation. Tuesday\u2019s move may represent a completed pullback to test former support as resistance, setting the stage for a continuation lower. A decline below Monday\u2019s low of $62.20 would trigger an inside day, with further weakness confirmed on a break under last Friday\u2019s low at $61.84.Crude oil continues to trend lower in a series of declining swing highs and lows, forming the structure of a falling bullish wedge. However, last week\u2019s drop to a new low below $62.19 confirmed a bearish continuation signal, increasing the odds of another leg lower. Price action suggests that the wedge formation is still evolving, and the next downside target is around $60.65. That level lines up with both the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement and a prior support shelf from May. Importantly, the wedge pattern allows for a move into that zone while maintaining its technical structure.On the weekly timeframe, crude continues to face resistance at the 20-Week moving average as well, now at $65.19. That level has held firm for four consecutive weeks, reinforcing its importance. Unless crude oil can decisively close above the 20-Week average, the likelihood of reaching the lower $60.65 target zone remains high.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar.

At this point, the market is still trying to absorb the excess oil supply in the market, and a slowing economy.WTI OilBrent OilThe light sweet crude oil market has rallied a little bit during the early hours on Tuesday, but really at this point in time, it\u2019ll be interesting to see whether or not we can continue the upward trajectory. We are at least in the process of trying to form some type of double bottom, perhaps anchored on the $62 level. The move to the upside will be somewhat limited though. I think the 50 day EMA sitting just below the $65 level might cause some problems, assuming we even go that far. Anything above $65 then starts to face the significant resistance zone that extends to the $66 level. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t know if crude oil does anything other than just simply go back and forth here.Brent markets look very much the same. I would suggest that perhaps the range in Brent is somewhat defined already, with 65 on the bottom being support and 70 on the top being resistance. If we break down below $65, that could bring us a move down to the $62 level, which would more likely than not drag the light, sweet crude oil market right along with it.Keep in mind that oversupply coming out of Russia, OPEC, and the United States is the biggest issue we have here. But we also have to keep in mind that the global economy seems like it could be struggling a bit.

A breakout above $66.03, the swing top, would confirm broader upward strength.On the downside, immediate support is seen at $61.45, with major support at $61.12. A breakdown below this level could expose crude to a retest of the May low at $56.09\u2014a critical line of defense for bulls.OPEC+ announced it will raise production by just 137,000 barrels per day starting in October\u2014well below previous increases of 550,000 bpd in August and September. This has added support to crude prices, with traders skeptical that even the modest hike will be fully realized. UBS and Saxo Bank analysts both highlighted the limited spare capacity across OPEC+, noting this leaves little buffer to absorb sudden supply shocks.China continues to act as a quiet stabilizer for crude markets. Analysts estimate that the country has been purchasing around 500,000 bpd for stockpiling, absorbing much of the excess global output. Gunvor\u2019s chief strategist sees this trend persisting into 2026, suggesting a consistent underlying bid in the physical market.Geopolitical risk is also lending a bullish bias. Fresh speculation about additional sanctions on Russia followed reports of the country\u2019s largest aerial strike on Ukraine to date. U.S. officials have indicated readiness for a new wave of restrictions, which could directly impact Russian oil exports and further strain global supply.Adding to the bullish mix is growing anticipation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting. Lower rates could stimulate economic activity and, in turn, support oil demand.Crude remains technically rangebound below its 200-day moving average, but the broader market tone is bullish. With OPEC+ supply tight, China absorbing barrels, and geopolitical risks rising, traders appear poised to test resistance levels. A firm break above $63.31 would likely attract follow-through buying, targeting the mid-$60s.

The smaller hike underscores the group\u2019s caution as global supply shifts toward a potential surplus.Adding to supply concerns, U.S. President Donald Trump signaled tougher sanctions on Russia after Moscow carried out its largest aerial strikes on Ukraine since the war began. Any new restrictions could disrupt Russian crude flows, a key pillar of global supply.However, gains were tempered by Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to cut October selling prices for all crude grades to Asian buyers, reflecting softer regional demand and a more cautious outlook.Natural gas is trading near $3.14, holding within an upward channel on the 4-hour chart.

OPEC and IEA split on oil outlook, while Russia and Middle East risks keep prices underpinned.WTI OilLight crude oil futures are bouncing back early Friday after yesterday\u2019s sharp sell-off, with buyers stepping in near the intraday low of $61.69. That defense aligns with the September 5 bottom at $61.45 and the August 13 low at $61.12, reinforcing these levels as firm technical support.The rebound leaves futures up about 1.34% for the week, but momentum remains capped at the 200-day moving average of $63.30. A sustained push above this barrier could spark a rally toward the 50-day moving average at $64.30 and the long-term 50% retracement at $64.56. Beyond that, the $66.18 level remains a critical ceiling for any meaningful bullish extension.At 10:07 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures are trading $62.57, up $0.20 or +0.32%.Fresh supply forecasts are weighing on sentiment. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported Thursday that global supply growth will outpace prior projections due to planned output increases from OPEC+ producers, including Russia.By contrast, OPEC\u2019s own monthly report reaffirmed its higher oil demand growth outlook, citing steady global economic momentum. This divergence highlights the market\u2019s central tension: while OPEC sees demand support, traders remain wary of an oversupplied market that could drag futures lower if consumption lags.Supply disruption risk continues to act as a counterbalance to bearish oversupply expectations. A drone strike on Russia\u2019s Primorsk port\u2014one of its largest export hubs\u2014set fire to a vessel and a pumping station, underscoring the vulnerability of key infrastructure.The incident adds to ongoing geopolitical uncertainty from conflicts in both the Middle East and Ukraine, reinforcing the geopolitical premium embedded in crude prices.On the physical side, India\u2019s Adani Group\u2014the country\u2019s largest private port operator\u2014has barred tankers under Western sanctions from entering its ports. Since India is the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne crude, this move could disrupt flows and complicate Moscow\u2019s efforts to reroute exports under sanctions pressure.Combined with potential secondary sanctions on Russian crude buyers, traders are keeping a close eye on India\u2019s import policies as a potential swing factor for seaborne supplies.Crude oil is holding support at recent lows while geopolitical risks and refined product tightness continue to underpin prices. However, oversupply concerns and resistance at $63.30 remain immediate hurdles.If buyers push through that level, momentum could target $64.30\u201364.56 before testing the heavier ceiling at $66.18. Until then, price action suggests a cautious but slightly bullish tilt, with traders watching supply risks to sustain upward momentum.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

On the U.S. side, we could do it faster, and I think it would be good if those dates were moved up even more. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s going to happen, but that was dialogued,\" he said, referring to his meeting with Jorgensen.A European Commission spokesperson declined to comment on Wright\u2019s remarks.Jorgensen said on Thursday it was unacceptable the EU continued to import Russian energy - but that the 2028 phase out was ambitious and would ensure EU countries do not face energy price spikes or supply shortages.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week the bloc was considering a faster phase-out of Russian fossil fuels as part of new sanctions against Moscow, without specifying how Brussels would do this.New sanctions require unanimous approval from all 27 EU members. Hungary and Slovakia have so far opposed sanctions on Russian gas - which is why the EU proposed the 2028 phase out, in a law which can be approved by a reinforced majority of EU countries.Europe is expected to purchase around 13% of its gas from Russia this year, down from roughly 45% before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, EU data show.Neither the U.S. government nor the EU Commission control gas deals, which are agreed by producers and buyers in a global market.Rabobank energy strategist Florence Schmit said a faster Russian gas exit was feasible - but only if Washington intervened to ensure that U.S. LNG exporters redirect supply to Europe from other markets.\"An earlier phase-out would be possible with sufficient government intervention and higher market prices,\" Schmit said, adding that the 20-23 billion cubic metres in LNG export capacity the U.S. is set to add next year is nearly enough to replace the EU\u2019s Russian gas imports, forecast at 25 bcm this year.Rystad Energy senior analyst Jan-Eric F\u00e4hnrich added that a faster phase out would only work if Asian LNG demand does not significantly recover next year, depending on how mild or cold the coming winter is.

Compared to the quarter before, however, the second quarter figure was a negative 0.6%, indicating the economy has lost speed in recent months.The deficit increased to 4.9 trillion rubles ($58 billion) in the January-July period, up from 1.1 trillion rubles the year before. Spending was 129% of the planned amount, according to the Kyiv School of Economics, which tracks the Russian economy and oil revenues. Meanwhile oil and gas revenues fell 19% compared with the year earlier period, in part due to slack global oil prices.Despite sanctions that have deprived Russia of foreign investment in some industries and the loss of its natural gas sales to Europe, the economy has held up better than many expected at the start of the war. Unemployment is at record lows and household incomes are rising. Recruitment bonuses have pumped cash into poorer regions. Oil shipments have remained steady even as the price has fluctuated.Meanwhile the government is able to finance its deficit by selling ruble bonds to domestic banks, which are eager to buy the bonds because they anticipate that interest rates will continue to fall.", "analysis": 1}, "46": {"type": "news", "title": "BC-Crude Oil Futures", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bc-crude-oil-futures-140015826.html", "date": "2025-09-12T14:00:15.000Z", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Prices as of 10:00:00 AM Friday, September 12.Light Sweet Crude (NYMX)1,000 bbl.- dollars per bbl.ContractOpenHighLowLastChangeToday's VolumeThursday's VolumeOct 2562.2763.9861.6963.34+.97150751196786Nov 2561.9563.6661.4263.02+.9484898122849Dec 2561.7963.4061.2062.76+.917434598273Jan 2661.6563.2161.1062.61+.892053135439Feb 2661.5963.1061.1062.49+.851667217554Mar 2661.5663.0261.0462.44+.832046325296Apr 2661.4462.9461.0562.36+.7863107617May 2661.2962.7361.0562.32+.7532113162Jun 2661.5262.8661.0262.30+.752227725742Jul 2661.4862.3461.0962.29+.799621719Aug 2661.0462.1161.0462.11+.667501033Sep 2661.1862.6760.9562.14+.7236273710Oct 2662.1462.1862.1462.16+.76448707Nov 2662.3362.3362.3362.33+.91450347Dec 2661.3262.6560.9362.14+.712219625825Jun 2761.3962.5761.2662.40+.7840374559Dec 2761.8662.9661.6162.51+.5254788734Jun 2863.0563.0563.0563.05+.73204669Dec 2862.4963.4162.3763.01+.367712307Est vol 439,459Thu.'s vol 583,941Open int 1,983,991Open Interest Change -31487", "analysis": 2}, "47": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil Rebounds as U.K. Targets Russia With Fresh Sanctions", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/bc119c61-dcd3-34b6-a3c2-e812773acd85/oil-rebounds-as-u-k-targets.html", "date": "2025-09-12T12:16:00.000Z", "body": "Oil prices rebounded in afternoon trade after the U.K. unveiled a fresh package of 100 sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s oil flows and military machine.", "analysis": 2}, "48": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil jumps nearly 2% after drones strike Russian terminal", "source": "investing", "link": "https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-prices-extend-losses-on-oversupply-us-demand-concerns-4236322", "date": "2025-09-12T13:44:00+00:00", "body": "By Seher Dareen and Alex Lawler(Reuters) - Oil prices rose by nearly 2% on Friday after a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian port suspended loadings, outweighing pressure from oversupply concerns and weaker U.S.\u00a0demand risks.The drone attack on Russia\u2019s northwestern port of Primorsk - one of the country\u2019s largest oil and fuel export terminals - led to a suspension of oil loading operations overnight, an official from Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service told Reuters.\"Those attacks on Russian energy infrastructure have room to drag down Russian crude and refined product exports,\" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.Brent crude futures\u00a0rose $1.02, or 1.5%,\u00a0to\u00a0$67.39 a barrel by 1328 GMT and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude\u00a0gained $1.08, or 1.7%, to\u00a0$63.45.The Kremlin said on Friday that there was a pause in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.Negotiators have held three rounds of direct talks this year in Istanbul, most recently on July 23, but the two sides remain far apart on how a possible peace deal might look, which could trigger further Western sanctions against Russia.\"Strong sanctions could potentially overshadow the underlying oversupply outlook,\" said SEB Research analyst Ole Hvalbye.The Brent and WTI benchmarks had fallen by 1.7% and 2% respectively on Thursday.A monthly report from the International Energy Agency on Thursday said that global oil supply would rise more rapidly than expected this year because of planned output increases by the OPEC+ group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia.However, OPEC\u2019s own report later in the day made no change to its relatively high forecasts for oil demand growth this year and next, saying the global economy was maintaining a solid growth trend.On the supply side, India\u2019s largest private port operator, Adani Group, has banned tankers sanctioned by Western countries from entering all of its ports, three sources told Reuters and documents show, potentially curbing Russian oil supplies.India is the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne oil, mostly shipped on tankers that are under sanctions by the European Union, the United States and Britain.

By doing so, the market looks as if it is going to continue the overall sideways action, with the 50-day EMA at $64.41 offering a bit of a ceiling and, of course, the $62 level offering support.So, with that being said, the market is likely to continue to go back and forth in this general vicinity. And that does make a certain amount of sense because quite frankly, I think a lot of people don\u2019t know what to do with the economic situation and projecting demand for crude oil, especially as Russia, OPEC and the United States pump out massive amounts of crude oil.The Brent market initially pulled back, only to show signs of strength as we are now testing the 50-day EMA.

Prices sank in early trading on oversupply jitters, only to rip higher by late morning as Russia once again stole the show.WTI was last at $63.79, up 2.28%, with Brent climbing 2.40% to $67.96. Natural gas was quieter, nudging up 0.27%. The surge came hours after a very different mood set the tone; concerns over swelling inventories and sluggish demand had pushed crude lower this morning, feeding the familiar narrative of too much oil chasing too few buyers.But markets quickly turned. Reports of fresh risks to Russian output, layered on top of already tightening OPEC+ dynamics, gave traders reason to reverse course. Sanctions chatter and infrastructure vulnerabilities in Russia injected just enough doubt about supply security to trump the glut storyline. In short, when barrels from one of the world\u2019s top producers look even remotely uncertain, bears scatter.The price swing shows just how brittle sentiment has become. Weeks of modest OPEC+ quota hikes have fueled talk of a looming surplus, yet the slightest hint of disruption in Russia\u2014or slowing U.S. output growth\u2014can light a fire under prices.Today\u2019s rally reminds us that oil doesn\u2019t move on tidy balance sheets alone.

The partnership also has a storage capacity of more than 300 million barrels (MMBbls). The asset portfolio generating steady cash flows indicates a stable business model, which is less vulnerable to volatility in commodity prices. This is because the pipelines are booked by shippers for a long term, providing stability from volume and price risks.On top of that, the under-construction, $6 billion worth of capital midstream projects will ensure further stability in generating incremental cash flows for unit holders. EPD, which already hiked distribution for 27 consecutive years, will thus be able to reward unitholders with additional distributions.Kinder Morgan Inc. KMI and\u00a0Enbridge Inc. ENB also have strong project backlogs to support their incremental future cash flows.As of June 30, 2025, Kinder Morgan had a project backlog of $9.3 billion.

This is a market that\u2019s been going sideways for a while, and it looks like we are paying close attention to the $60 level, extending all the way to the $62 level for significant support. All things being equal, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noisy sideways action as we are trying to form some type of bottom.That being said though, if we were to break down below the $60 level, then you can see this market really start to plunge. All things being equal though, I think it\u2019s a lack of demand and overproduction by Russia, OPEC and the United States that will continue to keep oil somewhat soft.Brent markets look very much the same, although the support level in Brent is clearly the $65 level. The $70 level above offers significant resistance and this too, it looks like a market that probably goes sideways for a while. I do think we\u2019re trying to find some type of bottom. The question of course is, can we pick up enough demand to make that happen?If the Federal Reserve starts to cut rates, it could, at least in theory, have people looking for expansion of economic activity. And that could be your positive case for oil. That being said, the market already expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates, and yet here we are. So, I think at this point we\u2019re trying to find some type of range to trade in, with I suspect $65 being your floor.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.Chris is a proprietary trader with more than 20 years of experience across various markets, including currencies, indices and commodities.

Japan is also imposing fresh export sanctions on Russian firms and additional asset freezes, as part of its efforts to help the international push to end the war in Ukraine, chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a regular news briefing on Friday, as carried by Reuters.The Japanese move follows the EU\u2019s price cap cut from July, when the European Union lowered the price cap on Russian crude oil to $47.60 from $60 per barrel as it adopted the 18th sanctions package against Russia, targeting a hundred more \u2018shadow fleet\u2019 tankers, energy trade, and traders and banks enabling it.The 18th sanctions package seeks to curtail Russia\u2019s energy revenues, with the lower price cap \u201cto align it with current global oil prices,\u201d the EU said.The price cap mechanism set by the G7 and the EU says that Russian crude shipments to third countries can use Western insurance and financing if cargoes are sold at or below a certain ceiling, which is now $47.60 per barrel for the EU and Japan.Japan\u2019s imports of Russian oil, which have accounted for a tiny 0.1% share so far this year, would not be affected as the Asian economy imports oil from the by-product from the Sakhalin-2 project, which is exempted from the price cap rule. Japan gets about 9% of its LNG from Sakhalin-2.The fresh Japanese sanctions on Russia come as U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly urged U.S. partner countries in the G7 group to impose tariffs on China and India in punishment for their continued energy trade with Russia.By Michael Kern for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.comBeijing's Ambitious Plan to Double Energy Storage by 2027Global EV Sales Growth Slows as Chinese Surge CoolsIEA Slashes Clean Hydrogen Production ForecastRead this article on OilPrice.com", "analysis": 1}, "55": {"type": "news", "title": "European stocks mixed; inflation, growth data in spotlight", "source": "investing", "link": "https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/european-stocks-just-higher-inflation-growth-data-in-spotlight-4236447", "date": "2025-09-12T15:49:47+00:00", "body": "Investing.com - European stocks closed in a mixed fashion on Friday, consolidating following a generally positive week, as investors digested regional inflation and growth data.\u00a0The DAX index in Germany and the CAC 40 in France were flat, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. fell 0.2%.\u00a0Even so, the three benchmark indices are on track to record weekly gains, with the French CAC-40 almost 2% higher, recovering amid political turmoil.The U.K. economy showed signs of a summer slowdown as July gross domestic product came in flat, with growth stagnating following a relatively robust first half of 2025, during which the British economy expanded by 0.7% in the first quarter and 0.3% in the second.According to data released Friday by the Office for National Statistics, the economy registered no growth in July, easing from the 0.4% expansion recorded in June.Elsewhere, German inflation rose to 2.1% in August, the federal statistics office said on Friday, confirming preliminary data.German consumer prices, harmonised to compare with other European Union countries, had risen by 1.8% year-on-year in July.Similar data from France and Spain are also set to confirm that inflation remains largely under control within the eurozone.The European Central Bank left rates unchanged on Thursday and maintained an upbeat view on growth and inflation, dampening expectations for any further cut in borrowing costs.Across the pond, U.S. CPI came in largely as expected on Thursday, pointing to the Federal Reserve resuming its easing cycle with a 25 basis-point cut next week.Banco de Sabadell\u2019s (BME:SABE) board has unanimously rejected BBVA\u2019s (BME:BBVA) hostile takeover bid, urging shareholders not to tender their stock, in a move that sets up a prolonged standoff between two of Spain\u2019s largest lenders.\u00a0This decision came just a few days after BBVA formally launched its offer for Sabadell shares.Sabadell\u2019s directors said the deal undervalues the bank, overstates potential cost savings, and leaves its shareholders exposed to risks tied to execution and regulatory limits.The board also cited Spain\u2019s regulatory restrictions on large bank mergers as a reason to resist.\u00a0Oil prices have risen on Friday, following the previous session\u2019s sharp losses on concerns about the possible softening of U.S. demand as well as oversupply worries.At 11:50 ET, Brent futures gained 1.6% to $67.42 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 1.4% to $63.24 a barrel.Oil fell nearly 2% on Thursday, but the crude benchmarks are still on course for weekly gains after strength at the start of the week on the potential for disruptions to output or trade flows from conflict and war.An Energy Information Administration report on Wednesday said U.S. crude stocks rose last week by 3.9 million barrels to 424.6 million barrels, suggesting demand in the largest energy consumer in the world is set to slow as the year progresses.Additionally, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly report world oil supply would rise more rapidly than expected this year due to planned output increases by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+.ProPicks AI evaluates BBVA alongside thousands of other companies every month using 100+ financial metrics.

its war in Ukraine, as the U.S. called on its allies to impose tariffs on purchasers of Russian oil.Canadian Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne chaired the G7 meeting, which was held to discuss further measures to increase pressure on Russia to end its war against Ukraine, according to a statement from Canada, the head of the rolling G7 presidency.The ministers agreed to speed up discussions to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s defense, and discussed a \"wide range of possible economic measures to increase pressure on Russia, including further sanctions and trade measures, such as tariffs, on those enabling Russia\u2019s war effort,\" the statement said.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told finance ministers during the call that they should join the U.S. in imposing tariffs on countries that purchase oil from Russia, Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a separate statement following the meeting.\"Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding Putin\u2019s war machine at the source will we be able to apply sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing,\" Bessent and Greer said.Bessent and Greer welcomed commitments made during the call to increase sanctions pressure and explore using immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine\u2019s defense, according to the joint statement.Earlier in the day, a U.S. Treasury spokesperson called on G7 and European Union allies to impose \"meaningful tariffs\" on goods from China and India to pressure them to halt their purchases of Russian oil.President Donald Trump has imposed an extra 25% tariff on imports from India to pressure New Delhi to halt its purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, bringing total punitive duties on Indian goods to 50% and souring trade negotiations between the two democracies.But Trump has refrained from imposing additional tariffs on Chinese imports over China\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, as his administration navigates a delicate trade truce with Beijing.Bessent is due to travel to Madrid on Friday for another round of talks with his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, that will cover trade issues, Washington\u2019s demands for Chinese-owned TikTok to divest its U.S. operations, and anti-money laundering issues.Trump earlier on Friday said that his patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin was running out, but stopped short of threatening new sanctions during a Fox News interview.Trump expressed frustration about Putin\u2019s failure to halt the war. He said sanctions on banks and oil were an option to increase pressure on Russia, but added that European countries also needed to participate.\"We\u2019re going to have to come down very, very strong,\" Trump said.

oil and gas fewer than expected between now and 2050 \u2013 with analysts linking the downgrade to Labour\u2019s imposition of 78pc taxes and a ban on new drilling.The assessment, by the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), the government regulator that reports to Mr Miliband, suggests the UK will have to import a far higher proportion of its oil and gas over the next 25 years.According to a separate analysis, the accelerated decline of the North Sea could see half the 200,000 jobs it supports destroyed by 2030.Many of those will be in Scotland, where elections due next year make such potential losses seriously risky for Labour\u2019s prospects.b''\u201cWe have already seen a 10pc reduction in output \u2013 equating to 100,000 barrels of oil a day, replaced by imports,\u201d said Chris Wheaton, an energy analyst with investment bank Stifel. \u201cThis will increase the longer the windfall tax stays in place \u2013 reaching 20pc below previous forecasts by 2030.\u201dThe downgrade in North Sea output emerges from comparing the production projections published by the NSTA in 2023 \u2013 before the election \u2013 with the latest versions, just published.In autumn 2023, the NSTA predicted the UK would produce oil and gas equivalent to 681 million tonnes of oil between 2025 and 2050.In the latest equivalent data, this has now been slashed to 557 million tonnes. The \u201clost\u201d 124 million tonnes equates to a billion barrels of oil.Splitting oil and gas, the NSTA data suggests the UK has lost 31 billion cubic metres of gas, enough for six months of UK consumption, and 70 million tonnes of oil \u2013 enough to supply the UK for a year.Mr Wheaton said: \u201cInvestment is being curtailed, and companies are voting with their feet. Chevron and Repsol are already exiting the UK North Sea, and [last week] TotalEnergies also announced plans to sell up.\u201dOffshore operators confirm the damage. Mark Lappin, a geologist who is chairman for Deltic Energy, which specialises in finding new sources of North Sea oil and gas, said the Government had implemented a \u201chostile policy\u201d towards the North Sea via windfall taxes and drilling bans.\u201cThat policy means investment is falling and companies are leaving, so inevitably future output will be lower than previously forecast,\u201d said Lappin, who is also the chairman of Brindex, which represents the North Sea\u2019s smaller independent oil producers.b''A separate analysis by trade body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) suggests the output lost because of government policy will be even higher, equating to 135 million tonnes of oil.", "analysis": 1}, "66": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil Prices Begin the Week With a Gain on Russian Infrastructure Attacks", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-begin-week-gain-044700380.html", "date": "2025-09-15T04:47:00.000Z", "body": "Crude oil prices began the week with a rise, building on gains made last week, as Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure continued, notably on a major oil export terminal in Primorsk, Russia\u2019s second-largest Baltic port and largest oil export hub on the Baltic.At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $67.29 per barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $63.06 per barrel, both up from opening.The Ukrainian forces attacked Primorsk with drones last week, causing damage to the Primorsk port and disrupting shipments at the terminal, which has the capacity to handle 1 million barrels of crude daily.

According to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. crude oil production hit an all-time high of 13.58 million barrels per day (mb/d) in June 2025, exceeding the previous record set in October 2024 by 50 thousand barrels per day (kb/d), and the pre-COVID November 2019 high by 582kb/d. Commodity experts at Standard Chartered have predicted that U.S. production will continue to grow before peaking at 14.34 mb/d in March 2026.However, the U.S. oil sector is already showing a clear trend of slowing growth, with the year-over-year increase clocking in at just 328kb/d in June. Further, production in Texas, the country\u2019s leading oil production hub, fell 33 kb/d y/y and is now 109 kb/d lower than its October 2024 peak of 5.832 mb/d. That said, this slowdown is not uniform, with small U.S. producers in decline but oil majors and independent producers continuing to grow. According to global energy consultant FGE, overall U.S. oil production increased throughout\u00a0 1H 2025 despite declines from smaller producers. This trend is pretty much in line with FGE's earlier prediction that lower crude prices will have the biggest impact on smaller, higher cost producers in the United States.Related: US Drillers See Slight Uptick in Oil ActivityAccording to the energy consultant, growth from smaller U.S. producers plateaued around mid-2024 and began to decline in 2H 2024 as lower oil prices started to kick in. With oil prices currently trading ~15/barrel lower than the 2025 peak, the decline has since continued, with FGE estimating that output from small producers will decline by 200-250 kb/d y-o-y in the second half of the current year.\u00a0 However, growth by U.S. oil majors will be enough to more than offset this decrease. FGE has also revised its 2025 global oil output up by 130 kb/d to 109.1 mmb/d and its 2026 forecast up by 230 kb/d to 110.4 mmb/d.In its latest Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the EIA has maintained its earlier forecast for U.S. crude and condensate to fall from 13.57 mb/d in December 2025 to 13.16 mb/d in December 2026. EIA has maintained its prediction despite June output coming in 100 kb/d above its estimates. The U.S. energy watchdog says prevailing low oil prices will be largely responsible for the falling output, prompting producers to slow down drilling and well completion activities.Source: FGECompensation Cuts To Offset OPEC+ UnwindingOn Sunday, the eight members of OPEC+ agreed to increase oil output from October by 137,000 barrels per day, a much lower clip compared to the 555,000 bpd increase announced for August and September and 411,000 bpd in June and July.", "analysis": 1}, "70": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil extends gains after attacks on Russian energy facilities", "source": "investing", "link": "https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-holds-gains-as-investors-eye-impact-from-attacks-on-russian-energy-facilities-4237864", "date": "2025-09-15T06:36:30+00:00", "body": "By Florence TanSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices extended gains on Monday as investors assessed the impact of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that could disrupt its crude and fuel exports, while also eyeing U.S. fuel-demand growth.Brent crude futures rose 47 cents, or 0.7%, to $67.46 a barrel by 0622 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $63.17 a barrel, up 48 cents, or 0.8%.Both contracts gained more than 1% last week as Ukraine stepped up attacks on Russian oil infrastructure, including the largest oil exporting terminal, Primorsk, and the Kirishinefteorgsintez refinery, one of the two largest refineries in Russia.\"The attack suggests a growing willingness to disrupt international oil markets, which has the potential to add upside pressure on oil prices,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Natasha Kaneva said in a note, referring to the attack on Primorsk.Primorsk has a capacity to load about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, making it a key export hub for Russian oil and the largest port in western Russia.The Kirishi refinery, operated by Surgutneftegaz, processes about 17.7 million metric tons per year, or 355,000 bpd, of Russian crude, equal to 6.4% of the country\u2019s total.\"If we are seeing a strategic shift by Ukraine towards Russian oil exporting infrastructure - that brings upside risks to forecasts,\" IG markets analyst Tony Sycamore said, despite ongoing concerns around oversupply as OPEC+ plans to ramp up output.An oil company in Russia\u2019s Bashkortostan region will maintain production levels despite a drone attack on Saturday, regional governor Radiy Khabirov said.Pressure is mounting on Russia as U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated on Sunday that he is willing to impose sanctions on Russia but Europe has to act in a way that is commensurate with the United States.Investors are also watching U.S.-China trade talks in Madrid that started on Sunday amid Washington\u2019s demands that its allies place tariffs on imports from China over its purchases of Russian oil.Last week, softer job-creation data and rising inflation in the U.S. raised concerns about economic growth in the world\u2019s largest economy and oil consumer, even as the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates during its September 16-17 meeting.The best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

However, the subsequent rally could be a labored event with a pair of pivots at $64.56 and $65.41 providing resistance initially, followed by the swing top at $66.03. This top is a potential trigger point for a surge into $68.70.Friday\u2019s price uptick was driven by reports that a Ukrainian drone attack had suspended crude loadings at one of Russia\u2019s largest western ports. Analysts warned this could curtail Russian crude and refined product exports, injecting new volatility into the supply side. The market also remains alert to potential secondary sanctions or tariffs from the U.S. aimed at reducing Russian oil exports to India and China, the two largest buyers of Moscow\u2019s seaborne crude.However, geopolitical support was fleeting. Brent and WTI benchmarks fell sharply on Thursday, down 1.7% and 2% respectively, underscoring market skepticism toward price rallies that aren\u2019t backed by tangible supply disruptions.Traders shifted their focus late in the week to U.S. economic indicators, which cast a shadow over demand prospects. The Labor Department\u2019s revised jobs data showed the economy had created 911,000 fewer jobs through March than previously estimated. At the same time, August\u2019s Consumer Price Index\u00a0jumped 0.4%, the largest increase since January.This combination of slower job growth and sticky inflation is raising doubts about the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to cut rates in the near term\u2014potentially stalling economic activity and curbing energy consumption.The International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a fresh warning that global oil supply would rise faster than demand this year, citing planned OPEC+ production increases. This confirms market concerns that the supply side continues to outweigh consumption. In contrast, OPEC maintained its higher demand growth projections, arguing that global economic momentum remains solid.Despite OPEC\u2019s optimistic tone, traders are increasingly positioning for a market that leans toward oversupply, especially as U.S. inventories build and refinery demand softens.India\u2019s Adani Group, the nation\u2019s largest private port operator, has banned tankers under Western sanctions from accessing its facilities. Since India is the top importer of Russian seaborne crude, this move introduces further uncertainty around global crude logistics and could restrict Moscow\u2019s ability to reroute exports under sanctions.The near-term outlook remains bearish, with traders wary of soft demand, rising U.S. inventories, and expanding OPEC+ output. While geopolitical tensions\u2014especially those affecting Russian infrastructure\u2014are preventing a deeper sell-off, they have not been enough to reverse the broader sentiment.Unless demand surprises to the upside or supply is materially disrupted, Light Crude Oil Futures are likely to remain under pressure next week, with rallies seen as selling opportunities in a market still dominated by oversupply concerns.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Facing signs of a labor market slowdown and elevated inflation, the Fed is tipped to slash rates by at least 25 basis points on Wednesday. Elsewhere, American and Chinese negotiators meet in Spain for the second day of discussions over issues like trade and the fate of the U.S. arm of ByteDance\u2019s popular TikTok app.1. Futures mixedU.S. stock futures hovered around both sides of the flatline on Monday ahead of a week filled with major central bank interest rate decisions, including announcements from the Fed, the Bank of Canada, and the Bank of England.By 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had risen by 9 points, or 0.1%, Nasdaq 100 futures had gained 29 points, or 0.1%, and Dow futures had slipped by 287 points, or 0.6%.The main averages on Wall Street were mixed at the end of trading last week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite logging a new record closing high and the benchmark S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average both edging lower.Bolstering the Nasdaq were shares in Microsoft, which jumped after the software giant averted a potential heavy antitrust penalty from the European Union by offering a reduced price for its Office service, excluding Teams.Tesla\u2019s stock price surged as well, fueled in part by the board chair of the electric carmaker saying that CEO Elon Musk was focused on running the company after a several-month stint at the White House.Traders were also assessing data from the University of Michigan which showed both weakening consumer sentiment in September and ongoing worry among households over a possible tariff-driven spike in inflation.2. Fed decision looms largeThe Fed will be in the spotlight this week, as markets are now all but certain that the central bank will slash interest rates at the end of its latest two-day gathering on Wednesday.Underpinned by signs of a softening U.S. labor market, policymakers are widely anticipated to back the first rate cut since an easing cycle was paused in December. Bringing down rates can, in theory, help spur investment and hiring.However, a reduction can risk pushing up inflationary pressures at the same time. Last week, a monthly U.S. consumer price index reading accelerated slightly due to an uptick in housing and food costs, a potential indication of sticky inflation.Yet a separate gauge displaying a rise in weekly initial jobless claims likely kept a Fed rate cut on track. There is now a roughly 95% probability that borrowing costs are lowered by 25 basis points, as well as about a 5% chance of a deeper half-point drawdown, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool. The Fed\u2019s target rate currently stands at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\"A cooling economy and weakening jobs market will help to dampen inflation tied to tariffs, and the Fed is now in a position to resume loosening policy from \u2019somewhat restrictive\u2019 territory towards a neutral footing,\" analysts at ING said in a note.3. U.S.-China officials meet in MadridU.S. and China officials are set to meet again after reportedly made little progress in the first day of a fresh round discussions on Sunday.Anticipation for the talks in Madrid has been subdued, particularly around a breakthrough on longstanding trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Observers are instead expecting the negotiations to conclude with an extension to a deadline for short-form video app TikTok -- which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance -- to divest its U.S. operations. At the moment, if ByteDance does not sell the unit by September 17, TikTok faces a shutdown in the U.S.Citing a source familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that President Donald Trump is likely to extend the deadline.Bessent told reporters that both sides would \"start again in the morning\" after they met for just six hours on Sunday. Meanwhile, China\u2019s embassy in Madrid informed reporters that a concluding news conference could take place on Monday, suggesting that the talks could wrap up soon. Bessent is set to head to London on Tuesday, prior to Trump\u2019s state visit with King Charles later in the week.4. China launches probe into U.S. chip policyBefore the start of the negotiations in Spain, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce opened an anti-discrimination probe into U.S. policy over the trade of chips.Beijing will be looking into whether Washington has unfairly discriminated against Chinese companies through a number of restrictions -- like export controls -- in recent years. The ministry argued that these moves have been designed to stem China\u2019s development of cutting-edge computing and artificial intelligence capabilities.A separate investigation was also initiated into suspected dumping of U.S. analog chips in everyday devices like temperature sensors and hearing aids. In a note, analysts at Vital Knowledge said investors should \"expect pressure\" on Monday in analog chip stocks such as Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, and NXP Semiconductors.5. Oil inches upOil prices rose, extending recent gains on the back of potential disruptions in Russian supply following Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow\u2019s energy infrastructure.At 03:27 ET, Brent futures climbed 0.5% to $67.29 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.1% to $62.76 a barrel.Both contracts gained more than 1% last week as Ukraine stepped up attacks on Russian oil infrastructure, including the largest oil exporting terminal Primorsk and the Kirishinefteorgsintez refinery, one of the two largest refineries in Russia.The strikes have the potential to take large amounts of Russian oil production offline, and could herald potential supply disruptions, especially for Moscow\u2019s top markets India and China.(Reuters contributed reporting.)With MSFT making headlines, savvy investors are asking: Is it truly valued fairly?

Sellers remain in control, and further weakness is likely before the session concludes. The decline triggered a small bear flag breakdown, following last week\u2019s larger flag failure, underscoring the fractal nature of current market pressure. Thursday marks the fifth consecutive rejection at the 20-Day line, highlighting the persistence of resistance and pointing to lower targets.The latest breakdown extends a sharp three-day slide, confirming aggressive selling pressure. Support at the recent $61.84 swing low is now vulnerable, with the next zone anchored by the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement at $60.66. This level is reinforced by a prior May support shelf. A measured move from the current bear flag identifies a target near $59.68, slightly below Fibonacci support, and now in focus for traders watching downside continuation.Despite the downside extension, the current decline remains within a developing falling potential bull wedge pattern. The wedge has already expanded once, with the upper boundary adjusted to connect the $66.52 swing high, which also aligned with resistance at the 50-Day moving average. This adjustment adds credibility to the revised wedge structure and raises the probability that the lower boundary may eventually be tested before the decline completes. Although not guaranteed, such a move would fit the evolving wedge framework.With only one trading day remaining in the week, crude oil appears set to close with a bearish candle if selling persists. Currently, an inside-week shooting star has formed, with prices holding near the lower end of the weekly range. This structure reinforces the short-term bearish tone and highlights the importance of upcoming support tests around $61.84 and $60.66 for the broader trend outlook. It also follows a bearish candle pattern from last week.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar.

You could, at least in theory, come up with the idea that we are in the midst of trying to form a little bit of a double bottom right at the $62 level. This is an area that\u2019s been important in the past as a fulcrum for price, so it does make a certain amount of sense.Any rally at this point in time, I think, is probably short-lived, and we already are trying to do that. The 50-day EMA is currently at the $64.48 level and dropping. I think that does offer a little bit of resistance. Anything above there, then opens up the possibility of the $66 level being targeted. If we were to break down below the $62 level, then it is possible we go looking at the $60 level.The Brent market continues to travel in the same pattern that it has for several weeks as we are pulling back from the 50-day EMA yet again. All things being equal, this is a market that I think is trying to get back down to the $65 level, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that plays out. If we were to break above the 50-day EMA, then it could open up and move toward the $70 level, which of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, an area that has been resistant and an area that is now attracting the 200 day EMA. It\u2019s difficult to imagine that oil is ready to break out anytime soon.

The market gave back Wednesday\u2019s conflict-driven gains, as traders shifted focus back to fundamentals.Brent crude\u00a0slipped 63 cents, or 0.9%, to $66.86 a barrel by midday in London, while WTI crude dropped 68 cents, or 1.1%, to $62.99. The previous session\u2019s rally\u2014fueled by Israel\u2019s strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar and NATO\u2019s interception of Russian drones over Poland\u2014proved short-lived as oversupply headlines dominated trading desks.The International Energy Agency warned Thursday that global oil supply is expected to rise faster than demand, citing increased production from OPEC+ and non-OPEC sources. OPEC+, which agreed Sunday to ramp up output starting in October, appears to be driving the imbalance. The IEA\u2019s call confirms what many traders already suspect\u2014supply is running ahead of consumption growth.Saudi Arabia, the bloc\u2019s largest producer, is aggressively targeting China with cut-price barrels. October exports are projected at 1.65 million bpd, up sharply from September\u2019s 1.43 million bpd. This increase in physical flows underscores the group\u2019s intent to hold market share, even at the risk of adding pressure to already soft prices.Latest EIA data revealed a surprise build of 3.9 million barrels in U.S. crude inventories\u00a0for the week ending September 5. Traders had anticipated a draw of around 1 million barrels. The bearish stock data, coupled with signs of weakening fuel demand, reinforces the view that the U.S. market is oversupplied.Meanwhile, Federal Reserve policy remains a wildcard. Expectations for a rate cut next week are already priced in, but traders are closely watching the U.S. inflation print due Thursday. A stronger-than-expected CPI could disrupt the bond rally and send crude lower on a stronger dollar.Technically, WTI crude remains range-bound below key moving averages. Price action is clustered around the 200-day moving average at $63.32, and upside momentum is unlikely to build without a firm break above the 50-day at $64.40. This setup suggests a market still lacking conviction.While geopolitical risks in the Middle East and Eastern Europe continue to provide short-term support, the broader crude oil outlook remains bearish. Rising OPEC+ output, swelling U.S. inventories, and lackluster demand are keeping a lid on rallies. Until supply tightens or demand surprises to the upside, traders should expect continued pressure on prices.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

The move aims to pressure Moscow into entering peace talks. EU leaders also signalled a faster phase-out of Russian energy. However, markets remain sceptical about actual supply disruptions. Without direct interruptions, geopolitical risk premiums may fade quickly.Despite the geopolitical rally, oil gains were capped. U.S. crude inventories increased by 3.9 million barrels last week. Gasoline and distillate stocks also increased significantly. This unexpected build signals weak near-term demand.The market now expects the Fed to cut rates in September. Upcoming inflation data will likely reinforce these expectations. Lower rates could support economic growth and boost oil demand. However, concerns remain about gasoline usage after the summer driving season. If demand drops sharply, oil prices may struggle to hold gains. For now, oil trades between supply concerns and geopolitical risks.The daily chart for WTI crude oil shows that the price has been consolidating within the long-term support band between the $60-$64 region. This support is further reinforced by an ascending channel pattern, with prices rebounding toward the 50-day SMA at $65.30.As long as the price remains below the 200-day SMA near the $67 level, the outlook for oil prices remains negative. A break below $60 would likely extend the downside move toward $55.50, and a drop below $55.50 could trigger a deeper sell-off in oil prices.On the upside, the key resistance lies at $77. A decisive break above this level would likely initiate a strong bullish move in oil prices.The 4-hour chart for WTI crude oil shows that the price has been trading below the red dotted trendline, indicating bearish price action. Strong resistance remains at the $65.50 level. A break above $65.50 could trigger a move toward the $70 region. On the downside, a break below $60 is needed to confirm further weakness in oil prices.The daily chart for natural gas shows that strong resistance has formed at the 50-day SMA near $3.20. This resistance may lead to a short-term correction in prices. However, a break above $3.20 could trigger a strong move toward the 200-day SMA at $3.50. On the downside, a break below $2.60 is needed to confirm further weakness. As long as the $2.60 support holds, the price may continue to move higher.The 4-hour chart for natural gas shows that the price has formed strong support at the $2.60 level and is facing resistance in the $3.20\u2013$3.40 zone. If the $2.90 support holds and the price breaks above $3.20, it will complete a mini inverted head and shoulders pattern on the technical chart. This breakout could trigger a strong move toward the $3.60 to $4.00 region in natural gas prices.The daily chart for the U.S. Dollar Index shows that the price has broken below the bear flag pattern near the 97.80 level. After the breakdown, the index rebounded toward this key level but remains weak ahead of the upcoming inflation data.The release of inflation figures will likely determine the next move in the Dollar Index and commodity prices. Meanwhile, the RSI remains below the 50 level, indicating continued bearish pressure and a likely move lower.The 4-hour chart for the U.S. Dollar Index shows that the index has been consolidating between the 97.20 and 98.60 levels for the past month. This extended consolidation around the key zone is adding to the bearish pressure.The downside bias remains intact as the index has failed to break above the 100.50 resistance. If upcoming inflation data pushes the index above 100.50, it may ease the short-term bearish pressure. However, a break below 96.50 would confirm a renewed downside move.Muhammad Umair is a finance MBA and engineering PhD.

This confirms short-term bullish control, with the next upside targets now shifting toward $64.40 and $66.18.Momentum indicators show rising strength, and with volume holding steady, traders will be watching for a sustained move toward the $68.70 zone if follow-through continues.Fundamentally, the rally came amid heightened geopolitical tension after Poland intercepted Russian drones and Israel conducted airstrikes in Qatar. While these headlines generated a near-2% jump in crude early Wednesday, the lack of actual supply disruption kept gains limited. Analysts at SEB noted that without real supply risk, geopolitical premiums tend to fade quickly\u2014evidenced by Brent\u2019s retracement from last week\u2019s highs.Bearish pressure also stems from inventory data. The EIA reported a crude build of 3.9 million barrels, well above consensus expectations for a draw. Gasoline stocks rose 1.5 million barrels and distillates jumped 4.7 million, reinforcing concerns of soft post-summer demand. With OPEC+ output rising, and U.S. production holding strong, the oversupply narrative remains intact even as WTI pushes higher technically.Brent crude settled higher on Wednesday, but the chart shows the contract remains capped beneath significant technical resistance. Prices closed at $67.29, with the 50-day moving average at $67.70 providing immediate pressure. Just overhead, the 200-day moving average at $69.79 represents the more decisive barrier, reinforced by the early September swing high at $69.33.The downside has recently been tested, with Brent finding support at $64.92 earlier this month after bouncing off the prior low at $64.73. That double floor offers a clear line of defense for bulls, but momentum is still weak.To shift sentiment, Brent would need to reclaim $69.79 on a daily close; failure to do so leaves the market vulnerable to another retest of support. But the first step in the recovery process is overtaking the 50-day moving average at $67.70.Upside potential remains contained unless Brent clears the $72.74 level from early August. Beyond that, the $77.77 peak remains the more distant bullish target. Until those levels are challenged, traders are likely to treat rallies as selling opportunities, particularly in light of the heavy supply narrative.Natural gas futures fell sharply, with the chart showing a breakdown toward $2.90 support on rising volume. October contracts failed to hold above $3.00, and price is now approaching key support at $2.887.A daily close below that level could trigger further selling toward $2.65. Momentum has turned bearish, and sellers are clearly in control short term.Fundamentals are driving the move lower.

So, with that being said, I think you\u2019ve got a situation where it just looks heavy. That being said, the market is likely to continue to see the $66 level above as a massive resistance barrier and the $62 level as a massive support level.I think ultimately, we\u2019re just somewhat stuck in this range. That being said, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been gradually getting bigger. So that is going to take some buying pressure out of the market. The EIA report comes out a little later, so pay attention to that.Brent also has rallied a bit during the trading session on Wednesday to show signs of life again as we threaten the 50-day EMA. That being said, the market is still very much in a range here as well, with $70 on the top offering resistance and $65 on the bottom offering support. The 50 day EMA is flat and again, we have a problem with overproduction.Russia, OPEC and the United States are all just drilling at full speed.

Separately, geopolitical risk escalated further as Poland intercepted drones during a Russian assault in Ukraine\u2014marking the first time a NATO country engaged directly. While tensions are elevated, traders noted the absence of any immediate supply disruptions.Despite the headlines, the rally failed to gain momentum. Analysts at SEB warned that \u201cthe dark cloud of surplus ahead\u201d continues to pressure the market, highlighting Brent\u2019s $2 drop from last Tuesday as evidence that geopolitical risk premiums are short-lived without a direct threat to supply.Adding to the political backdrop, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly urged the EU to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese and Indian imports. Both countries are major buyers of Russian oil, and any disruption to their access could have knock-on effects across global oil flows. However, aggressive sanctions risk clashing with inflation concerns and may complicate the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate decision.Traders continue to anticipate a Fed rate cut at the September 16-17 meeting\u2014a move that would likely stimulate economic activity and oil demand.

Since January 2022, the United States has imported $24.51 billion of Russian goods.FERTILIZERSLast year, the U.S. imported around $1.27 billion of Russian fertilizers, up slightly from $1.14 billion in 2021.URANIUM, PLUTONIUMThe U.S. imported enriched uranium and plutonium from Russia worth around $624 million in 2024, down from $646 million in 2021.PALLADIUMRussia exported palladium to the United States for around $878 million in 2024, down from $1.59 billion in 2021.The best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

Traders treated the level as resistance last week, but Friday\u2019s bounce off $61.69 has given bulls momentum to attempt a breakout. A sustained push higher would open the door toward last week\u2019s high at $64.08, the 50-day moving average at $64.28, and the long-term pivot at $64.56. On the downside, support sits at $62.77, with stronger protection between $61.45 and $61.12.At 09:19 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures are trading $62.82, up $0.13 or +0.21%.Markets continue to weigh supply risks after Ukraine launched its largest drone assault on Russian energy assets to date, targeting at least 361 facilities and sparking a fire at the Kirishi refinery. The attack followed earlier strikes on Primorsk, Russia\u2019s main crude export terminal with a 1 million bpd capacity. Analysts warn that a shift in Ukraine\u2019s strategy toward energy infrastructure could add sustained upside pressure on oil.At the political level, President Trump signaled the U.S. could impose fresh sanctions on Russia, but only if NATO allies also cut their purchases. The move underscores the geopolitical leverage energy continues to hold in transatlantic relations.While attacks raise the risk premium, traders must balance it against OPEC+ plans to increase output. Analysts argue that oversupply concerns remain in play, though disruptions to Russian refining and export facilities provide an offset. The geopolitical risk premium is preventing crude from fully reflecting weaker macro signals, including softer U.S. labor data and higher inflation reported last week.In parallel, Ukraine announced restrictions on diesel imports from India, citing concerns over Russian-origin crude being blended into supply chains. August imports from India totaled 119,000 tons, 18% of total diesel imports, but new testing requirements will slow inflows. The move adds another wrinkle to regional fuel markets already strained by refinery outages and Russian strikes.China\u2019s crude imports remain a swing factor, with August showing a surplus of just over 1 million bpd as intake outpaced refinery demand. The buildup suggests Beijing continues to add to strategic and commercial reserves, even as OPEC+ prepares to bring more supply online. Refiners appear to be positioning for lower price ranges in the $50\u201360 zone, but imports from sanctioned producers Russia, Iran, and Venezuela remain high.With futures pressing against technical resistance and geopolitics driving the risk premium, traders face a tug of war between supply risks and oversupply concerns. A breakout above $63.31 could accelerate momentum toward $64.56, though failure would keep the market rangebound. Sanctions chatter, OPEC+ output decisions, and China\u2019s stockpiling remain the key external drivers this week. Crude remains a headline-sensitive trade, with dips likely supported by both technical levels and geopolitical uncertainty.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Futures have about 70 bps of Fed cuts priced over the three meetings to year-end and stock futures are flat to firmer ahead of Monday\u2019s bell. A Senate vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s latest Fed board nominee - White House adviser Stephen Miran - is due on Monday.\u00a0* Along with the Fed, the Bank of Canada is also expected to trim rates this week - but the Bank of England and Bank of Japan are likely to hold steady. A wave of weak Chinese economic numbers for this month showed ebbing retail and industrial growth but merely reinforced expectations for more fiscal stimulus and markets were steady to firmer. The dollar was a touch lower as the week kicked off, with an eye on U.S. retail and industrial updates tomorrow and even as longer-term Treasury yields nudged higher.* Geopolitical and economic risks added to the mix. Fitch\u2019s expected downgrade of France\u2019s sovereign credit rating to A+ late on Friday underscored the fiscal strains in the euro zone\u2019s second-largest economy and the task facing its new Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu.

OPEC and IEA split on oil outlook, while Russia and Middle East risks keep prices underpinned.WTI OilLight crude oil futures are bouncing back early Friday after yesterday\u2019s sharp sell-off, with buyers stepping in near the intraday low of $61.69. That defense aligns with the September 5 bottom at $61.45 and the August 13 low at $61.12, reinforcing these levels as firm technical support.The rebound leaves futures up about 1.34% for the week, but momentum remains capped at the 200-day moving average of $63.30. A sustained push above this barrier could spark a rally toward the 50-day moving average at $64.30 and the long-term 50% retracement at $64.56. Beyond that, the $66.18 level remains a critical ceiling for any meaningful bullish extension.At 10:07 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures are trading $62.57, up $0.20 or +0.32%.Fresh supply forecasts are weighing on sentiment. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported Thursday that global supply growth will outpace prior projections due to planned output increases from OPEC+ producers, including Russia.By contrast, OPEC\u2019s own monthly report reaffirmed its higher oil demand growth outlook, citing steady global economic momentum. This divergence highlights the market\u2019s central tension: while OPEC sees demand support, traders remain wary of an oversupplied market that could drag futures lower if consumption lags.Supply disruption risk continues to act as a counterbalance to bearish oversupply expectations. A drone strike on Russia\u2019s Primorsk port\u2014one of its largest export hubs\u2014set fire to a vessel and a pumping station, underscoring the vulnerability of key infrastructure.The incident adds to ongoing geopolitical uncertainty from conflicts in both the Middle East and Ukraine, reinforcing the geopolitical premium embedded in crude prices.On the physical side, India\u2019s Adani Group\u2014the country\u2019s largest private port operator\u2014has barred tankers under Western sanctions from entering its ports. Since India is the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne crude, this move could disrupt flows and complicate Moscow\u2019s efforts to reroute exports under sanctions pressure.Combined with potential secondary sanctions on Russian crude buyers, traders are keeping a close eye on India\u2019s import policies as a potential swing factor for seaborne supplies.Crude oil is holding support at recent lows while geopolitical risks and refined product tightness continue to underpin prices. However, oversupply concerns and resistance at $63.30 remain immediate hurdles.If buyers push through that level, momentum could target $64.30\u201364.56 before testing the heavier ceiling at $66.18. Until then, price action suggests a cautious but slightly bullish tilt, with traders watching supply risks to sustain upward momentum.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Bringing down rates can, in theory, help spur investment and hiring.However, a reduction can risk pushing up inflationary pressures at the same time. Last week, a monthly U.S. consumer price index reading accelerated slightly due to an uptick in housing and food costs, a potential indication of sticky inflation.Yet a separate gauge displaying a rise in weekly initial jobless claims likely kept a Fed rate cut on track.There is now a roughly 95% probability that borrowing costs are lowered by 25 basis points, as well as about a 5% chance of a deeper half-point drawdown, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool.

However, the best source is always domestic, which is why MOL treats hydrocarbon exploration in Hungary as a priority.\u201dMOL started drilling operations at Galgah\u00e9v\u00edz-4 within the Mogyor\u00f3d concession area at the end of May this year, reported HungaryToday.The well reached its designated depth in just 37 days and has since been put into operation following successful testing.The drilling was executed by MOL\u2019s subsidiary, Rotary, using the R-69 rig.MOL is a leading hydrocarbon producer in Hungary, operating close to 1,300 oil and gas wells. Hungary represents 39% of its total production.Last year, the company accounted for 47% of the country's crude oil production and nearly 80% of its natural gas output.Earlier this year, MOL and Turkish Petroleum secured concession agreements with Hungary's Ministry of Energy.The agreements allow for joint hydrocarbon exploration in the Tam\u00e1si and Buzs\u00e1k areas.\"MOL, O&GD discover new oilfield near Budapest, Hungary\" was originally created and published by Offshore Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\u00a0The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Bringing down rates can, in theory, help spur investment and hiring.Data released earlier Monday also showed a deterioration in the NY Empire manufacturing index, dropping to -8.7 in September from 11.90 the prior month.\u00a0However, a reduction can risk pushing up inflationary pressures at the same time. Last week, a monthly U.S. consumer price index reading accelerated slightly due to an uptick in housing and food costs, a potential indication of sticky inflation.Yet a separate gauge displaying a rise in weekly initial jobless claims likely kept a Fed rate cut on track.There is now a roughly 95% probability that borrowing costs are lowered by 25 basis points, as well as about a 5% chance of a deeper half-point drawdown, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool.

So far, harsher sanctions have had a \"modest impact\" on supply and trade flows, the IEA noted, despite exports from both of the countries trending lower in recent months.Still, a separate report from OPEC itself made no change to its relatively elevated forecasts for oil demand growth in 2025 and next year.Although Brent could be pushed higher by the potential sanctions on Russia in particular, the HSBC analysts argued that the \"oil market is oversupplied and could absorb significant disruptions.\"Oil prices rose on Monday, extending recent gains after Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure.

Ultimately, this is a market that I think you need to pay close attention to these levels, and we\u2019ll see how this plays out.But right now, I think oil is trying to find its basing pattern, its range, if you will, for the time of year. After all, there are a lot of concerns about global growth. So, I think that and the oversupply coming out of OPEC, Russia and the United States keeps markets suppressed a bit, but there is a certain level where drilling for oil no longer becomes sensible to do. So obviously, we can\u2019t get crushed. More things lead me in the direction in this market of thinking sideways than anything else.Brent markets look very much sideways as well, with the $65 level offering significant support and the $69 level offering significant resistance. We are basically in the middle of the range and at this point, topped by the fact that we have the 50 day EMA right here. I think this is a market that you\u2019re looking for short term back and forth trading, which has been the way this market has traded pretty much most of the year, with the exception of a couple erratic moves. So, at this point, I think we\u2019ve got back and forth grinding choppy short term scalping type of environment.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.Chris is a proprietary trader with more than 20 years of experience across various markets, including currencies, indices and commodities.

By doing so, the market looks as if it is going to continue the overall sideways action, with the 50-day EMA at $64.41 offering a bit of a ceiling and, of course, the $62 level offering support.So, with that being said, the market is likely to continue to go back and forth in this general vicinity. And that does make a certain amount of sense because quite frankly, I think a lot of people don\u2019t know what to do with the economic situation and projecting demand for crude oil, especially as Russia, OPEC and the United States pump out massive amounts of crude oil.The Brent market initially pulled back, only to show signs of strength as we are now testing the 50-day EMA. Breaking above the 50-day EMA opens up the possibility of a move to higher levels, perhaps the $70 level. At this point in time, it looks like the $65 level is going to continue being support. Ultimately, I think we\u2019re in the midst of trying to form a bottom. Whether or not we can remains to be seen, but I do think you have a situation where we are looking at this through the prism of wait and see for a bigger move in the short term.

The drones hit Russia\u2019s Kirishi refinery in northwestern Leningrad region, intensifying weeks of Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure. Operated by Surgutneftegas, the giant refinery has a capacity to process 17.7 million metric tons of crude per year (355,000 barrels per day), making it one of Russia\u2019s three largest refineries by output. Previously, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was ready to impose fresh sanctions on Russia if Western nations stopped buying Russian oil. Brent crude for October delivery was trading up 0.4% to $67.29 per barrel AT 12.30 pm ET on Monday, while the comparable contract for WTI crude gained 0.7% to trade at $63.15 per barrel.\"The attack suggests a growing willingness to disrupt international oil markets, which has the potential to add upside pressure on oil prices,\" JPMorgan analyst Natasha Kaneva told Reuters.A wave of strikes in recent weeks has hit major refining sites in the Volga and southern regions. Fires and unplanned outages at Ryazan, Syzran, and Novoshakhtinsk have underscored how exposed Russia\u2019s downstream sector has become to low-cost, long-range systems designed to bypass layered air defenses.Related: China Continues to Amass Crude Oil in StorageUkraine has been using a conventional long-range strike arsenal from its western allies on Russian energy infrastructure over the past two years. The country has been relying heavily on Storm Shadow missiles by the United Kingdom and SCALP-EG missiles by France to maintain long-range strike capability. However, Ukraine quickly realized that relying too heavily on its western allies was not sustainable in the long-run, partly because Europe failed to restart missile production at scale while American missiles came with strict targeting restrictions.Kyiv has been rapidly beefing up its long-range strike program, and has managed to develop a fairly robust supply chain of long-range drones such as the AQ-400 Scythe, AN-196 Liutyi and FP-1, complemented by a range of mini-cruise missiles across multiple production lines. Unlike long-range drones, Ukraine\u2019s mini-cruise missiles offer greater speed and payload capacity. Last year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that his government would supply the country\u2019s armed forces with 30,000 long-range and deep-strike weapons in 2025.Ukraine, however, still lacked a home-grown heavy hitter missile that combines long range with high speed and high payload capacity. Whereas Ukraine\u2019s long-range mini-cruise missiles and drones are capable of reaching deep into Russian territory, they can only carry small payloads in the 10 to 100 kilograms (22lbs-220lbs) range. Moreover, they are slow, making them easier to intercept and have low kinetic energy, thus making their impact less lethal. However, that changed in August after Ukraine unveiled the FP-5 Flamingo, a heavy cruise missile capable of carrying a 1,150-kilogram payload and traveling 3,000km (almost 1,900 miles).", "analysis": 2}, "126": {"type": "news", "title": "Attacks on Russia Lifts Oil Price Despite Shaky Fundamentals", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/af94e68b-ef37-312b-9d5d-b9c264a1f5c9/attacks-on-russia-lifts-oil.html", "date": "2025-09-15T20:37:00.000Z", "body": "Oil futures started the week higher with new Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries maintaining a level of geopolitical risk premium.", "analysis": 2}, "127": {"type": "news", "title": "California Just Got More Oil-Friendly.

Four years ago an IEA report said there should be no investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world was serious about meeting climate targets.Drawing on production data from about 15,000 oil and gas fields around the world, the new IEA report said the average global rates for annual post-peak decline are 5.6% for conventional oil output and 6.8% for conventional natural gas.A halt in upstream investment would cut oil supply by 5.5 million barrels per day each year, the IEA said, up from just under 4 million bpd in 2010. The 5.5 million bpd figure is roughly equal to Brazil\u2019s and Norway\u2019s output combined.The decline for natural gas has risen to 270 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year from 180 bcm, it said.As of 2024, about 80% of global oil production and 90% of natural gas production came from fields that had passed their peak in production, the report said.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

Trump had slapped India with 50% trade tariffs in late-August over the matter.Trump was also seen calling on the NATO, European Union, and G7 countries to stop buying Russian oil and to increase tariff pressure on India and China.\u00a0Concerns over Russian supply disruptions helped oil markets look past an otherwise bloated outlook for supply in the coming quarters. Steadily increasing output from the OPEC, coupled with strong production in non-OPEC countries, is expected to drive up global oil levels in the coming months.\u00a0Global oil demand is also expected to remain on the backfoot, having barely recovered in China over the past two years. U.S. fuel demand is also expected to cool during the winter season.\u00a0Bernstein analysts said Brent was at risk of sliding to $60/barrel if supply continued to outpace demand, and that the global oil surplus could rise to 1.9 million barrels per day in this quarter.\u00a0The only source of upside could be stricter sanctions against Russia, Bernstein said.\u00a0A softer dollar benefited oil in recent weeks, as the greenback was dented by expectations of an interest rate cut by the Fed this week.The central bank is widely expected to cut rates by at least 25 basis points on Wednesday, amid some cooling in the labor market.\u00a0But the Fed\u2019s outlook on rates remains uncertain, especially in the face of sticky inflation.Still, lower rates stand to boost economic activity and could potentially drive up oil demand.\u00a0\u00a0The best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

Gold prices hit a record high as the U.S. dollar weakened.Traders widely expect the Fed to deliver a 25 basis-point cut at the end of its policy meeting on Wednesday, with the probability of such a move near 100%, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool.MSCI\u2019s All-Country Index rose as high as 977.09, up 0.50%, topping last week\u2019s record high. On Wall Street, all three main indexes closed higher with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting fresh intraday record highs.Communication services, consumer discretionary, and technology stocks were the biggest gainers while consumer staples, healthcare and materials equities drove losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average\u00a0rose\u00a00.11% to\u00a045,883.45, the S&P 500\u00a0rose\u00a00.47% to\u00a06,615.28\u00a0and the Nasdaq Composite\u00a0rose\u00a00.94% to\u00a022,348.75.\u00a0Stocks in Europe rose 0.42% on the day, finishing near a three-week high with luxury and defense stocks boosting the main index\"Today it looks like we\u2019re still in a wait-and-see mode for the Fed meeting and announcement,\" said Wasif Latif, chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners in New Jersey. \"We\u2019ve had a big run up in the market that continues to see new highs in anticipation of the Fed and today seems to be moving in the same direction.\"Key too will be Fed members\u2019 \"dot plot\" projections for rates and guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on the extent and pace of any further easing. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 2.4 basis points to 4.036%.Futures already have 125 basis points of cuts priced in by late 2026, so anything less than dovish will likely disappoint investors.\"What\u2019s interesting is that we\u2019ve already seen prices move significantly in anticipation of the cut, so the question is will the rate announcement itself turn into a sell-on-the-news today or not,\" Latif added.U.S. President Donald Trump continued his attacks on the central bank on Sunday, saying Powell was incompetent and hurting the housing market.\u00a0The Bank of Canada is also expected to cut rates by a quarter point this week, while the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England are both seen holding rates steady.\u00a0In currencies, the U.S. dollar dropped against its peers ahead of the Fed\u2019s expected rate cut. It was down 0.17% to 147.42 against the Japanese yen and was down 0.27% to 0.79420 against the Swiss franc.The dollar index fell\u00a00.36%\u00a0to\u00a097.31.The euro shrugged off Fitch\u2019s downgrade of France late last week, rising 0.23% to $1.176075. It was a touch weaker against sterling, trading at 86.44 pence, down 0.1% on the day.\u00a0The euro has been underpinned by a steady outlook for EU rates, with the European Central Bank signaling last week it was in a \"good place\" on policy. A host of ECB officials are due to speak this week, including President Christine Lagarde.The United States and China reached a framework agreement to switch short-video app TikTok to U.S.-controlled ownership, an arrangement that will be confirmed in a call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, U.S. officials said.Nvidia\u2019s finished flat, erasing earlier session losses, after China\u2019s market regulator said on Monday that a preliminary investigation had found that the company had violated the country\u2019s anti-monopoly law, marking the latest hit for the U.S. chip giant.\u00a0Oil prices rose as investors assessed the impact of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries.Brent crude futures settled up 0.67% to $67.44 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 settled at $63.30 a barrel, up 0.97%.Gold prices hit a new record high, underpinned by a softer dollar and lower Treasury yields.

In my column today I look at the U.S. housing and labor markets, and how the simultaneous declines in both threaten to feed off each other and create a powerful headwind for the economy.If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today. 1.

Oil futures up 1%.Today\u2019s Talking Points:* US-SINO TRADEU.S.-China trade talks took a forward leap on Monday, with a framework agreement reached to switch TikTok to U.S.-controlled ownership and President Donald Trump confirming he will talk to Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Friday.Tech and AI are very much at the heart of the talks, and there may be a lot of hard bargaining still to be done. Beijing also said on Monday that a preliminary investigation of Nvidia found the U.S. chip giant had violated its anti-monopoly law.* Tech-tonic fizzWhether it be price, valuation, or concentration, investors know there are reasonable grounds to at least be cautious on the U.S. tech/AI boom. But it shows no sign of slowing, far less reversing, and on Monday it broke new ground.Tesla surged on CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $1 billion share purchase, Alphabet joined the $3 trillion club, and the communication services sector rose 2.3% - despite Nvidia\u2019s lackluster performance on news of China\u2019s probe. The sector is now up 27% this year, more than double the S&P 500 index\u2019s 12% gain.* Fragile ChinaThe Chinese economic \"data dump\" for August has been pretty unambiguous - Asia\u2019s largest economy is struggling. The latest readings of inflation, industrial production, bank lending, urban investment and retail sales have all missed expectations, while one of the few indicators to surprise in the upside was the unemployment rate.This will add pressure on Beijing to inject more fiscal stimulus to ensure this year\u2019s growth target of \"around 5%\" is met. Chinese stocks have climbed sharply lately and the yuan is its strongest this year. But these bets on a sustained recovery may be premature. Again.U.S. economy braces for twin housing, labor market headwindsThe U.S. labor market appears to be deteriorating rapidly just as the country\u2019s housing market is also creaking, two negative forces that risk feeding off each other and smothering economic growth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the labor side, the latest sweep of data shows why the Federal Reserve is almost certain to resume its interest rate-cutting cycle this week - the unemployment rate and weekly jobless claims are both the highest since 2021, and unemployed people now outnumber available jobs for the first time in four years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, pressure in the housing market remains elevated. Average monthly mortgage payments are nearly double pre-pandemic levels, and overall affordability is near record lows. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this month that the government may soon declare a national housing emergency.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He has reason to be worried. High mortgage rates and soaring rents can weigh on consumer spending, leading to lower corporate profits, and ultimately less hiring and more firing. Rising unemployment, of course, puts further downward pressure on spending, creating a vicious negative spiral.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adding to these worries is the fact that many homeowners can\u2019t move even if they want to, as they are locked into ultra-low mortgage rates secured in the aftermath of the pandemic. As a result, mobility is falling, just when the labor market needs a more flexible and dynamic workforce. In other words, at exactly the wrong time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DECLINING MOBILITYHigh mortgage rates and soaring rents are exacerbating a long-standing U.S. housing crisis. The country currently has a record 4.7 million fewer units than it needs, according to realtor Zillow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s bad news for the economy \u2013 long lauded for its flexibility \u2013 because a lack of affordable housing limits labor mobility. That, in turn, can fuel higher unemployment in certain regions and make it hard for businesses in thriving regions to fill positions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Limited access to housing \"directly impacts the efficiency and flexibility of the labor market,\" says Shelley Stewart III, a senior partner at McKinsey. \"Addressing housing affordability can alleviate these imbalances, leading to a more dynamic and balanced labor market.\"Indeed, according to academic research cited in a Bipartisan Policy Center report last year, if three of the country\u2019s \u2019productive job markets\u2019 \u2013 New York City, San Francisco, and San Jose - had adequate housing in the 45 years between 1964 and 2009, the U.S. economy would be 3.7% bigger. Failure to improve housing affordability damages U.S. economic growth over the long term, not just this cycle.WHAT TO DO?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s not all gloom and doom, though.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, technology could help maintain some labor mobility despite the housing crunch. The number of households with flexibility to work remotely and thus live further away from the office tripled between 2019 and 2021, the Bipartisan Policy Center study found. This may partially explain the increased migration in recent years of households to the South and Mountain West from the Northeast and Midwest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But work-from-home policies can only do so much. Consider that the overall rate of movement within the U.S. was less than 9% in 2022, compared with an annual average of almost 20% between 1948 and 1980.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, there are some signs that the housing squeeze may be easing. The recent decline in long-term U.S. government bond yields has brought average 30-year mortgage rates to an 11-month low of 6.35%, while rising inventory and sluggish demand are capping house prices.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Americans seem unconvinced. Nearly 70% report being concerned about the rising cost of housing, an increase of eight percentage points from a year earlier, according to\u00a0a McKinsey study. That negative sentiment could chill consumer spending regardless of the facts on the ground, especially when coupled with intensifying job fears.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So\u00a0what else can be done?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Building new homes is the obvious answer. Investment in the housing sector has a strong multiplier effect on economic growth and tax revenues. McKinsey estimates that investing to close the housing shortfall could create up to 1.7 million jobs and add nearly $2 trillion in cumulative GDP through 2035.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But investment on that scale will be hard to execute, especially when conditions in the sector are so fragile.\u00a0And it will take time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the short term, therefore, the economy can\u2019t bank on a housing renaissance. A more realistic hope may be that monetary easing, fiscal largesse and the Trump administration\u2019s deregulation drive will provide enough of a tailwind to offset these two rather powerful headwinds.What could move markets tomorrow? * UK unemployment * Germany ZEW sentiment index (September) * Euro zone industrial production (July) * Canada inflation (August) * U.S. industrial production (August) * U.S. retail sales (August) * U.S. Treasury auctions $13 billion of 20-year notesWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

India for their purchases of Russian oil in an effort to convince Russia to end the war in Ukraine.Escalation of geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East is bullish for crude prices.

\u00a0This is less than the 547,000 bpd increase the group decided to boost output in September and August. \u00a0OPEC+ also said restarting the remainder of the 1.66 million bpd crude production it

global crude surplus estimate to 3.33 million bpd, +360,000 bpd higher than anticipated in August, citing plans by OPEC+ to revive its crude production.Concerns about higher OPEC production are

Recent disruptions at a major Russian refinery, with capacity of 355,000 barrels per day, and earlier damage to an export hub handling up to 1 million bpd, underscored vulnerability in global supply chains.Meanwhile, reports of potential EU sanctions on firms linked to Russian oil flows added further uncertainty. Traders are also watching for a possible Federal Reserve rate cut, which could lift fuel demand, keeping oil and gas markets finely balanced between risk and opportunity.Natural gas is trading at $3.02, holding above its rising trendline that\u2019s been intact since late August. The 50-EMA at $3.01 is acting as immediate support, while the 200-EMA at $3.06 is capping upside momentum, creating a narrow squeeze zone. This compression often precedes a breakout.Price action has been choppy, with recent candles showing long wicks, reflecting a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. The RSI sits at 54, neutral but tilting higher, suggesting mild bullish pressure.If buyers clear $3.06, the next test sits at $3.14, followed by $3.21. On the downside, a break below $2.99 risks retests of $2.89 and $2.81. For now, natural gas is coiling, with traders watching closely for which side wins the breakout.WTI crude oil is trading at $63.47, sitting just below key resistance at $64.07. The 4-hour chart shows price pressing against a descending trendline while holding above the 50-EMA at $63.14. The 200-EMA at $64.00 adds another barrier, making this zone critical for direction.Candlestick structure has shifted into tighter ranges, reflecting hesitation before a potential move. The RSI at 56 leans slightly bullish, suggesting buyers are trying to regain control.A close above $64.07 could open the way toward $65.00 and $66.00, while failure to clear this zone may trigger a pullback to $62.40 or even $61.50. For now, the battle between bulls and bears hinges on whether $64 can be decisively broken.Brent crude oil is trading at $67.55, consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. This setup reflects indecision, as buyers and sellers converge toward a breakout point.

This attack was described as the most damaging to date in Russia\u2019s northwest, which triggered fires that halted operations. This loss of output comes at a time when oil markets are already tight, potentially reducing refined product availability and pushing prices higher.In addition to the refinery outage, Ukrainian forces damaged two tankers and key infrastructure at the Primorsk oil terminal. Although partial operations have resumed, loading capacity may remain down by as much as 50%, significantly slowing Russia\u2019s crude exports. With Primorsk handling up to 1 million barrels per day, even a temporary disruption can send ripple effects through global oil supply chains.Oil traders now face rising uncertainty over Russian exports through the Baltic. As loading schedules are delayed and infrastructure repairs continue, supply risks are intensifying just as seasonal demand begins to rise. If Ukraine continues targeting critical energy infrastructure, markets could experience sustained upward pressure on oil prices amid fears of prolonged export disruptions.The daily chart for WTI crude oil (CL) shows a rebound from the support of the ascending channel pattern. The $60 to $55.50 range remains a key long-term support zone, where prices are currently consolidating. However, the 50-day SMA remains below the 200-day SMA, indicating ongoing bearish pressure.A break above the 200-day SMA near the $67 level could trigger a strong rebound toward the $75\u2013$77 region. Conversely, a break below $60 would signal a continuation of the negative trend in WTI crude oil.Despite bearish pressure, WTI crude oil prices are consolidating near the edge of a triangle pattern above the $60 area, indicating potential bullish price action. This is supported by the formation of a double bottom around the $55 region in April and May 2025. A break above the $65 level would signal another rebound, with upside targets toward the $75 region in WTI crude oil.The 4-hour chart for WTI crude further highlights the bullish price action, as the price is consolidating within the edge of a triangle pattern. A break above $65 would signal further upside, while a break below $61.60 would invalidate the triangle and resume the downward trend.The daily chart for natural gas (NG) shows that prices are forming a bullish price action above the $2.60 level. A strong rebound from the neckline of the cup-and-handle pattern suggests that natural gas is gaining bullish momentum.This bullish momentum indicates that further upside is likely toward the 200-day SMA resistance near $3.60. Additionally, the RSI is approaching the 50 level, reinforcing the potential for continued gains.The 4-hour chart for natural gas shows a strong bullish price action forming above the $2.60 area. A break above $3.18 will signal further upside in natural gas prices, while a break below $2.60 would suggest a continuation of the downtrend.The daily chart for the US Dollar Index shows that it has broken below the bear flag pattern and is continuing its downward momentum. Consolidation below the 50-day SMA suggests the index is poised for a significant decline. Moreover, the RSI remains below the mid-level, indicating further downside potential for the US dollar.The 4-hour chart for the US Dollar Index shows that it is approaching the support level at 97.20. A break below this level would end the one-month consolidation and signal further downside, confirming continued bearish price action.Muhammad Umair is a finance MBA and engineering PhD.

Trump is now expected to appeal the case in the Supreme Court.Separately, Trump\u2019s nomination to the Fed Board of Governors, economist Stephen Miran, was approved by the Senate in a narrow vote on Monday evening.

As a result, producers must ramp up investment simply to keep global supply from falling.The IEA\u2019s new report, \u2018The Implications of Oil and Gas Field Decline Rates\u2019, analyzed production data from around 15,000 fields. It found that nearly 90% of annual upstream investment goes toward offsetting declines, rather than boosting output.\u201cDecline rates are the elephant in the room for any discussion of investment needs in oil and gas, and our new analysis shows that they have accelerated in recent years,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.In oil, a halt to new upstream spending would now strip 5.5 million barrels per day from global supply each year, up from just under 4 million in 2010.Natural gas decline rates have also worsened, rising from 180 billion cubic metres a year to 270 bcm.Decline rates differ sharply by field type. Giant onshore fields in the Middle East lose less than 2% annually, while smaller offshore fields in Europe can see declines of more than 15%. Tight oil and shale gas drop even more steeply, with output falling by over 35% in the first year alone without reinvestment.To hold production steady through 2050, more than 45 million barrels per day of new oil supply and nearly 2,000 bcm of gas from conventional fields would be required, the agency said \u2014 the equivalent of adding the combined output of the world\u2019s three largest producers.\u201cThe situation means that the industry has to run much faster just to stand still. And careful attention needs to be paid to the potential consequences for market balances, energy security and emissions,\u201d Birol warned.The IEA\u2019s new report also highlights that it takes nearly 20 years on average from licence award to first oil or gas, with roughly a decade spent on discoveries and another on approvals and construction.The best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

A Ukrainian drone strike that disrupted loadings at Russia\u2019s Primorsk port contributed to the week\u2019s strength, raising concerns over Russian export flows. However, gains were ultimately constrained by soft U.S. economic data, rising inventories, and ongoing concerns about oversupply, keeping overall sentiment cautious.Despite the higher close for the week, the market finished on the weakside of the 52-week moving average at $63.45 for the second week in a row. This indicator is controlling the longer-term direction of the market.A sustained move under the 52-week moving average will signal the presence of sellers. If this generates enough downside momentum then look for a drive toward the swing bottom at $61.12, followed by a Fibonacci level at $60.26. The latter is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the downside.Overcoming the 52-week moving average will indicate the return of buyers. However, the subsequent rally could be a labored event with a pair of pivots at $64.56 and $65.41 providing resistance initially, followed by the swing top at $66.03. This top is a potential trigger point for a surge into $68.70.Friday\u2019s price uptick was driven by reports that a Ukrainian drone attack had suspended crude loadings at one of Russia\u2019s largest western ports. Analysts warned this could curtail Russian crude and refined product exports, injecting new volatility into the supply side. The market also remains alert to potential secondary sanctions or tariffs from the U.S. aimed at reducing Russian oil exports to India and China, the two largest buyers of Moscow\u2019s seaborne crude.However, geopolitical support was fleeting. Brent and WTI benchmarks fell sharply on Thursday, down 1.7% and 2% respectively, underscoring market skepticism toward price rallies that aren\u2019t backed by tangible supply disruptions.Traders shifted their focus late in the week to U.S. economic indicators, which cast a shadow over demand prospects. The Labor Department\u2019s revised jobs data showed the economy had created 911,000 fewer jobs through March than previously estimated. At the same time, August\u2019s Consumer Price Index\u00a0jumped 0.4%, the largest increase since January.This combination of slower job growth and sticky inflation is raising doubts about the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to cut rates in the near term\u2014potentially stalling economic activity and curbing energy consumption.The International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a fresh warning that global oil supply would rise faster than demand this year, citing planned OPEC+ production increases. This confirms market concerns that the supply side continues to outweigh consumption. In contrast, OPEC maintained its higher demand growth projections, arguing that global economic momentum remains solid.Despite OPEC\u2019s optimistic tone, traders are increasingly positioning for a market that leans toward oversupply, especially as U.S. inventories build and refinery demand softens.India\u2019s Adani Group, the nation\u2019s largest private port operator, has banned tankers under Western sanctions from accessing its facilities. Since India is the top importer of Russian seaborne crude, this move introduces further uncertainty around global crude logistics and could restrict Moscow\u2019s ability to reroute exports under sanctions.The near-term outlook remains bearish, with traders wary of soft demand, rising U.S. inventories, and expanding OPEC+ output. While geopolitical tensions\u2014especially those affecting Russian infrastructure\u2014are preventing a deeper sell-off, they have not been enough to reverse the broader sentiment.Unless demand surprises to the upside or supply is materially disrupted, Light Crude Oil Futures are likely to remain under pressure next week, with rallies seen as selling opportunities in a market still dominated by oversupply concerns.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Sellers remain in control, and further weakness is likely before the session concludes. The decline triggered a small bear flag breakdown, following last week\u2019s larger flag failure, underscoring the fractal nature of current market pressure. Thursday marks the fifth consecutive rejection at the 20-Day line, highlighting the persistence of resistance and pointing to lower targets.The latest breakdown extends a sharp three-day slide, confirming aggressive selling pressure. Support at the recent $61.84 swing low is now vulnerable, with the next zone anchored by the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement at $60.66. This level is reinforced by a prior May support shelf. A measured move from the current bear flag identifies a target near $59.68, slightly below Fibonacci support, and now in focus for traders watching downside continuation.Despite the downside extension, the current decline remains within a developing falling potential bull wedge pattern. The wedge has already expanded once, with the upper boundary adjusted to connect the $66.52 swing high, which also aligned with resistance at the 50-Day moving average. This adjustment adds credibility to the revised wedge structure and raises the probability that the lower boundary may eventually be tested before the decline completes. Although not guaranteed, such a move would fit the evolving wedge framework.With only one trading day remaining in the week, crude oil appears set to close with a bearish candle if selling persists. Currently, an inside-week shooting star has formed, with prices holding near the lower end of the weekly range. This structure reinforces the short-term bearish tone and highlights the importance of upcoming support tests around $61.84 and $60.66 for the broader trend outlook.

You could, at least in theory, come up with the idea that we are in the midst of trying to form a little bit of a double bottom right at the $62 level. This is an area that\u2019s been important in the past as a fulcrum for price, so it does make a certain amount of sense.Any rally at this point in time, I think, is probably short-lived, and we already are trying to do that. The 50-day EMA is currently at the $64.48 level and dropping. I think that does offer a little bit of resistance. Anything above there, then opens up the possibility of the $66 level being targeted. If we were to break down below the $62 level, then it is possible we go looking at the $60 level.The Brent market continues to travel in the same pattern that it has for several weeks as we are pulling back from the 50-day EMA yet again. All things being equal, this is a market that I think is trying to get back down to the $65 level, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that plays out. If we were to break above the 50-day EMA, then it could open up and move toward the $70 level, which of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, an area that has been resistant and an area that is now attracting the 200 day EMA. It\u2019s difficult to imagine that oil is ready to break out anytime soon.

Traders treated the level as resistance last week, but Friday\u2019s bounce off $61.69 has given bulls momentum to attempt a breakout. A sustained push higher would open the door toward last week\u2019s high at $64.08, the 50-day moving average at $64.28, and the long-term pivot at $64.56. On the downside, support sits at $62.77, with stronger protection between $61.45 and $61.12.At 09:19 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures are trading $62.82, up $0.13 or +0.21%.Markets continue to weigh supply risks after Ukraine launched its largest drone assault on Russian energy assets to date, targeting at least 361 facilities and sparking a fire at the Kirishi refinery. The attack followed earlier strikes on Primorsk, Russia\u2019s main crude export terminal with a 1 million bpd capacity. Analysts warn that a shift in Ukraine\u2019s strategy toward energy infrastructure could add sustained upside pressure on oil.At the political level, President Trump signaled the U.S. could impose fresh sanctions on Russia, but only if NATO allies also cut their purchases. The move underscores the geopolitical leverage energy continues to hold in transatlantic relations.While attacks raise the risk premium, traders must balance it against OPEC+ plans to increase output. Analysts argue that oversupply concerns remain in play, though disruptions to Russian refining and export facilities provide an offset. The geopolitical risk premium is preventing crude from fully reflecting weaker macro signals, including softer U.S. labor data and higher inflation reported last week.In parallel, Ukraine announced restrictions on diesel imports from India, citing concerns over Russian-origin crude being blended into supply chains. August imports from India totaled 119,000 tons, 18% of total diesel imports, but new testing requirements will slow inflows. The move adds another wrinkle to regional fuel markets already strained by refinery outages and Russian strikes.China\u2019s crude imports remain a swing factor, with August showing a surplus of just over 1 million bpd as intake outpaced refinery demand. The buildup suggests Beijing continues to add to strategic and commercial reserves, even as OPEC+ prepares to bring more supply online. Refiners appear to be positioning for lower price ranges in the $50\u201360 zone, but imports from sanctioned producers Russia, Iran, and Venezuela remain high.With futures pressing against technical resistance and geopolitics driving the risk premium, traders face a tug of war between supply risks and oversupply concerns. A breakout above $63.31 could accelerate momentum toward $64.56, though failure would keep the market rangebound. Sanctions chatter, OPEC+ output decisions, and China\u2019s stockpiling remain the key external drivers this week. Crude remains a headline-sensitive trade, with dips likely supported by both technical levels and geopolitical uncertainty.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

OPEC and IEA split on oil outlook, while Russia and Middle East risks keep prices underpinned.WTI OilLight crude oil futures are bouncing back early Friday after yesterday\u2019s sharp sell-off, with buyers stepping in near the intraday low of $61.69. That defense aligns with the September 5 bottom at $61.45 and the August 13 low at $61.12, reinforcing these levels as firm technical support.The rebound leaves futures up about 1.34% for the week, but momentum remains capped at the 200-day moving average of $63.30. A sustained push above this barrier could spark a rally toward the 50-day moving average at $64.30 and the long-term 50% retracement at $64.56. Beyond that, the $66.18 level remains a critical ceiling for any meaningful bullish extension.At 10:07 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures are trading $62.57, up $0.20 or +0.32%.Fresh supply forecasts are weighing on sentiment. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported Thursday that global supply growth will outpace prior projections due to planned output increases from OPEC+ producers, including Russia.By contrast, OPEC\u2019s own monthly report reaffirmed its higher oil demand growth outlook, citing steady global economic momentum. This divergence highlights the market\u2019s central tension: while OPEC sees demand support, traders remain wary of an oversupplied market that could drag futures lower if consumption lags.Supply disruption risk continues to act as a counterbalance to bearish oversupply expectations. A drone strike on Russia\u2019s Primorsk port\u2014one of its largest export hubs\u2014set fire to a vessel and a pumping station, underscoring the vulnerability of key infrastructure.The incident adds to ongoing geopolitical uncertainty from conflicts in both the Middle East and Ukraine, reinforcing the geopolitical premium embedded in crude prices.On the physical side, India\u2019s Adani Group\u2014the country\u2019s largest private port operator\u2014has barred tankers under Western sanctions from entering its ports. Since India is the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne crude, this move could disrupt flows and complicate Moscow\u2019s efforts to reroute exports under sanctions pressure.Combined with potential secondary sanctions on Russian crude buyers, traders are keeping a close eye on India\u2019s import policies as a potential swing factor for seaborne supplies.Crude oil is holding support at recent lows while geopolitical risks and refined product tightness continue to underpin prices. However, oversupply concerns and resistance at $63.30 remain immediate hurdles.If buyers push through that level, momentum could target $64.30\u201364.56 before testing the heavier ceiling at $66.18. Until then, price action suggests a cautious but slightly bullish tilt, with traders watching supply risks to sustain upward momentum.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up $1.03, or 1.6%, to $64.33 a barrel.Russia\u2019s oil pipeline monopoly Transneft has warned producers they may have to cut output following Ukraine\u2019s drone attacks on critical export ports and refineries, three industry sources said.Ukraine has intensified attacks on Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure as talks to end their conflict have stalled.\"An attack on an export terminal like Primorsk is aimed more at limiting Russia\u2019s ability to sell its oil abroad, affecting export markets,\" said JP Morgan analysts.\"More importantly, the attack suggests a growing willingness to disrupt international oil markets, which has the potential to add upside pressure on oil prices,\" they said.Goldman Sachs estimates that the Ukrainian attacks have taken out about 300,000 barrels per day of Russian refining capacity in August and so far this month.The situation in Russia warrants close monitoring as it could lead to more tightness in U.S. diesel markets, StoneX energy analyst Alex Hodes said.\"Should Russian refineries suffer substantial damage, it could increase demand for U.S. diesel exports and potentially sustain the inverted forward curve,\" Hodes said.U.S. diesel futures were last up 1.9%, outpacing both WTI oil and U.S. gasoline futures.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said the government would not impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods to encourage China to halt purchases of Russian oil unless European countries hit China and India, the biggest buyers of Russian crude, with duties of their own.Also on investors\u2019 radar is the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s September 16-17 meeting, at which the bank is widely expected to cut interest rates.\u00a0While lower borrowing costs typically boost fuel demand, analysts were cautious on the health of the overall U.S. economy.Markets were also factoring in the likelihood of crude inventory declines in the U.S. last week, with official data expected on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.A Reuters poll on Monday showed analysts expected U.S. crude oil and gasoline stockpiles to have fallen last week, while distillate inventories likely rose.

A clean break above this level would reinforce bullish momentum, setting the stage for a run at the long-term pivot at $64.56. Above that, upside targets include $65.41 and the September 2 main top at $66.03.Bullish sentiment was further fueled by renewed supply concerns tied to escalating Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil infrastructure. Russia\u2019s Transneft has warned producers they may need to curb output due to repeated strikes on key ports and refineries.

While looser monetary policy could support energy demand by lowering borrowing costs, analysts remain cautious on the broader U.S. economic outlook. Still, any dovish pivot from the Fed would likely be interpreted as a bullish catalyst for crude, particularly if coupled with signs of tightening supply.The market is also awaiting official U.S. stockpile data on Wednesday. A Reuters poll showed expectations for declines in both crude and gasoline inventories last week, while distillate stocks likely posted a small increase. If confirmed, the drawdowns would further tighten the supply picture and lend support to current price levels.WTI\u2019s move above the 200-day average and its test of the 50-day signals growing bullish momentum. A confirmed breakout above $64.56 would likely accelerate gains toward $66.03, supported by geopolitical supply risks, a potentially dovish Fed, and expected U.S. inventory draws.

The crypto tracking firm Chainalysis reports that sanctioned jurisdictions and entities, such as Iran, received 15.8 billion dollars (\u00a311.5 billion) in cryptocurrency in 2024, accounting for about 39% of all illicit crypto transactions.The latest sanctions also come after France, Britain and Germany triggered a \u201csnapback mechanism \u201d that automatically reimposes all United Nations sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, saying Iran has wilfully departed from their 2015 nuclear deal that lifted the measures.The US and Iran tried to reach a new nuclear deal earlier this year, but those talks have not resumed since the 12-day Israeli bombardment of Iran\u2019s nuclear and military sites and the US bombardment on June 22.", "analysis": 1}, "174": {"type": "news", "title": "European stocks decline; Fed meeting, economic data in focus", "source": "investing", "link": "https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/european-stocks-slip-marginally-fed-meeting-economic-data-in-focus-4239800", "date": "2025-09-16T15:56:59+00:00", "body": "Investing.com - European stocks fell on Tuesday, awaiting news from the Federal Reserve policy meeting while digesting key regional economic data.\u00a0The DAX index in Germany dropped 1.6%, while the CAC 40 in France declined 0.9% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. fell 0.8%.\u00a0The Fed starts its latest two-day policy meeting later in the session, limiting activity as investors look for the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates at the conclusion on Wednesday, potentially offering global support.The Bank of England also meets later this week, but is widely expected to hold still on Thursday, having cut interest rates last month for the fifth time in just over a year.U.K. inflation came in at 3.8% in July, the highest in the Group of Seven advanced economies and almost twice the U.K.\u2019s central bank\u2019s medium-term target.However, data released earlier Tuesday showed U.K. employment falling for a seventh month in row and wage growth slowing, potentially easing worries at the Bank of England about persistent inflation pressures.There is more economic data to digest in the eurozone Tuesday, including Italian inflation, German ZEW economic sentiment and eurozone industrial production.Wider sentiment was also supported by progress in U.S.-China trade talks in Madrid.\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Washington and Beijing had reached a framework deal on TikTok\u2019s U.S. ownership.

But Moscow has managed to re-route most oil exports to Asia, where India and China are its primary buyers.Last week, Ukrainian drones hit Russia\u2019s biggest oil port of Primorsk for the first time since the war began in 2022, temporarily forcing operations there to shut down.Primorsk has capacity to export more than 1 million barrels of oil per day, or more than 10% of Russia\u2019s total oil production.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the strikes had inflicted significant damage and called attacks on Russian oil infrastructure \"the sanctions that work the fastest\".Reuters could not verify the extent of the damage from the strikes.Russia, unlike leading OPEC producer Saudi Arabia, does not have significant capacity to stockpile oil.Primorsk partially resumed operations on Saturday, though it remained unclear how long it may take to complete full repairs, the two sources said.Russian had already lost some oil exporting capacity following another drone attack targeting the Ust-Luga oil terminal on the Baltic Sea in August, according to industry sources.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia - a group known as OPEC+ - have been increasing production since April after years of cuts aimed at supporting the oil market.Under the latest OPEC+ agreement, Russia\u2019s oil production quota is due to rise to 9.449 million barrels per day this month from 9.344 million bpd in August.\"Russia\u2019s ability to ramp up oil production is now under threat due to limited storage capacity,\" U.S. bank J.P.

reversed higher Tuesday, reclaiming key averages and breaking out of a falling wedge, shifting momentum bullish and setting up a test of higher resistance.WTI OilCrude oil flipped the script on Tuesday. What looked like a bearish breakdown last week has now morphed into a sharp bullish reversal. Prices surged to a nine-day high of $64.90, erasing the downside implications of a failed bear flag. False moves often fuel fast moves, and crude\u2019s rally fits that mold. A strong close above $64.36 would confirm the breakout reversal and mark a decisive shift in momentum.The bulls scored two technical victories today. First, they reclaimed the 20-Day moving average at $64.02 \u2014 a level that has repeatedly capped rallies in recent weeks. More importantly, crude broke out of a falling wedge pattern at the same time it cleared the short-term range. Wedge breakouts are often early warning signs that a trend is turning, and this one is flashing in favor of higher prices.The next battle zone lies near the 50-Day average, currently $65.41. This level carries added weight thanks to an anchored VWAP from the April 9 low, sitting at the same price. A close above this dual resistance would further validate the reversal, opening the way for a push toward $66.53 \u2014 a swing high that aligns with the 50% retracement of the recent decline. Beyond that, the 200-Day average at $67.48 marks a logical upside target.Failed bearish setups can be powerful fuel for rallies, and crude\u2019s current bounce is a textbook example. Shorts caught on the wrong side may be forced to cover, providing additional buying pressure. With momentum shifting, the top boundary of the broader falling channel comes back into play as a potential medium-term target.The reversal is not just a daily story \u2014 it\u2019s showing up on the weekly chart too. A weekly bullish reversal highlights stronger demand on a larger scale and improves the probability of further gains. While upside follow-through is essential, the weight of evidence now tilts bullish, with multiple signs pointing to higher prices ahead.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar.

The $62 level underneath is significant support and the $65 level above is significant resistance. Keep in mind that the 50 day EMA sitting right around the $64.33 level will continue to offer a bit of a barrier as well. Ultimately, this is a market that I think you need to pay close attention to these levels, and we\u2019ll see how this plays out.But right now, I think oil is trying to find its basing pattern, its range, if you will, for the time of year. After all, there are a lot of concerns about global growth. So, I think that and the oversupply coming out of OPEC, Russia and the United States keeps markets suppressed a bit, but there is a certain level where drilling for oil no longer becomes sensible to do. So obviously, we can\u2019t get crushed. More things lead me in the direction in this market of thinking sideways than anything else.Brent markets look very much sideways as well, with the $65 level offering significant support and the $69 level offering significant resistance. We are basically in the middle of the range and at this point, topped by the fact that we have the 50 day EMA right here. I think this is a market that you\u2019re looking for short term back and forth trading, which has been the way this market has traded pretty much most of the year, with the exception of a couple erratic moves. So, at this point, I think we\u2019ve got back and forth grinding choppy short term scalping type of environment.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.Chris is a proprietary trader with more than 20 years of experience across various markets, including currencies, indices and commodities.

By doing so, the market looks as if it is going to continue the overall sideways action, with the 50-day EMA at $64.41 offering a bit of a ceiling and, of course, the $62 level offering support.So, with that being said, the market is likely to continue to go back and forth in this general vicinity. And that does make a certain amount of sense because quite frankly, I think a lot of people don\u2019t know what to do with the economic situation and projecting demand for crude oil, especially as Russia, OPEC and the United States pump out massive amounts of crude oil.The Brent market initially pulled back, only to show signs of strength as we are now testing the 50-day EMA. Breaking above the 50-day EMA opens up the possibility of a move to higher levels, perhaps the $70 level. At this point in time, it looks like the $65 level is going to continue being support. Ultimately, I think we\u2019re in the midst of trying to form a bottom. Whether or not we can remains to be seen, but I do think you have a situation where we are looking at this through the prism of wait and see for a bigger move in the short term.

dollar was supportive for energy prices. \u00a0Also, concerns over a decline in Russian oil exports are boosting prices after Ukraine stepped up its drone attacks on Russian refineries. \u00a0In addition, Monday's rally in the S&P 500 to a new record high shows confidence in the economic outlook and is supportive of energy demand and crude prices. \u00a0Gains in crude were limited after Monday's weaker-than-expected US and Chinese economic news signaled weakness in energy demand.Ukraine has stepped up its attacks on Russian refineries and oil infrastructure, which is bullish for crude prices as it curbs Russian crude exports and tightens global oil supplies. \u00a0The Kirishi refinery, one of Russia's biggest refineries that has an annual processing capacity of over 20 million tons, halted crude processing after damage caused by a Ukrainian drone attack on Sunday. \u00a0Also, Ukrainian drone attacks have damaged Russian oil infrastructure and crude-exporting hubs along Russia's Baltic Coast. \u00a0Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries have curbed Russia's crude-processing runs to 4.98 million bpd in the first three days of September, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25 years. \u00a0Monday's weaker-than-expected global economic news is bearish for energy demand and crude prices. \u00a0The US Sep Empire manufacturing survey of general business conditions fell -20.6 to a three-month low of -8.7, weaker than expectations of 5.0. \u00a0Also, China's Aug industrial production rose +5.2% y/y, weaker than expectations of +5.6% y/y. \u00a0In addition, the China Aug surveyed jobless rate unexpectedly rose +0.1 to a 6-month high of 5.3%, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of no change at 5.2%.A decrease in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bullish for oil prices. \u00a0Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days fell by -7.2% w/w to 67.96 million bbl in the week ended September 12.Crude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. \u00a0President Trump said last Friday that his patience with Russian President Putin was \"running out fast\" for continuing the war in Ukraine, and he threatened new economic sanctions against Russia. \u00a0The US proposed that the Group of Seven allies impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil in an effort to convince Russia to end the war in Ukraine.Escalation of geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East is bullish for crude prices. \u00a0Geopolitical tensions in Europe escalated last Wednesday after Poland shot down Russian drones that crossed into its territory in Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine. \u00a0Also, Israel last Tuesday launched a strike on Doha, Qatar, targeting the senior leadership of Hamas. \u00a0Qatar said the attack by Israel violated international law and threatens to widen the conflict in the Middle East, the source of about one-third of global oil supplies.Crude prices also have support after OPEC+ agreed on September 7 to raise its crude production by 137,000 bpd, starting in October. \u00a0This is less than the 547,000 bpd increase the group decided to boost output in September and August. \u00a0OPEC+ also said restarting the remainder of the 1.66 million bpd crude production it had idled will be contingent on \"evolving market conditions.\"Concerns about a global oil glut are bearish for crude prices after the International Energy Agency (IEA) last Thursday boosted its 2026 global crude surplus estimate to 3.33 million bpd, +360,000 bpd higher than anticipated in August, citing plans by OPEC+ to revive its crude production.Concerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices as OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. \u00a0OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of production capacity that is due to remain offline until late 2026. \u00a0OPEC Aug crude production rose by +400,000 bpd to 28.55 million bpd, the highest in over two years.Last Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of September 5 were -3.2% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.6% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -10.4% below the 5-year seasonal average. \u00a0US crude oil production in the week ending September 5 rose by +0.5% w/w to 13.495 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12/6/2024.Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending September 12 rose by +2 to 416 rigs, just above the 4-year low of 410 rigs from August 1. \u00a0Over the past 2.5 years, the number of

The breakout followed a clean bounce from the 200-EMA at $67.26 and the 50-EMA at $67.50, both now acting as layered support. Immediate resistance sits at $68.64, where the price stalled after a sharp rally.The RSI at 65 shows healthy bullish momentum without yet entering overbought territory, suggesting there\u2019s still room for further upside. If buyers maintain control above $68.00, the next targets come into play at $69.51 and potentially the psychological barrier at $70.00.On the downside, a close back below $67.80 would weaken this breakout, risking a pullback toward $67.02 or even $66.33.

for energy prices. \u00a0Also, concerns over a decline in Russian oil exports are boosting prices after Ukraine stepped up its drone attacks on Russian refineries. \u00a0In addition, today's rally in the S&P 500 to a new record high shows confidence in the economic outlook and is supportive of energy demand and crude prices. \u00a0Gains in crude are limited after today's weaker than expected US and Chinese economic news signal weakness in energy demand.Ukraine has stepped up its attacks on Russian refineries and oil infrastructure, which is bullish for crude prices as it curbs Russian crude exports and tightens global oil supplies. \u00a0The Kirishi refinery, one of Russia's biggest refineries that has an annual processing capacity of over 20 million tons, has halted crude processing after damage caused by a Ukrainian drone attack on Sunday. \u00a0Also, Ukrainian drone attacks have damaged Russian oil infrastructure and crude-exporting hubs along Russia's Baltic Coast. \u00a0Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries have curbed Russia's crude-processing runs to 5.09 million bpd in the first 27 days of August, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25

for oil prices. \u00a0Vortexa reported today that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days fell by -7.2% w/w to 67.96 million bbl in the week ended September 12.Crude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. \u00a0President Trump said last Friday that his patience with Russian President Putin was \"running out fast\" for continuing the war in Ukraine, and he threatened new economic sanctions against Russia. \u00a0The US proposed that the Group of Seven allies impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil in an effort to convince Russia to end the war in Ukraine.Escalation of geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East is bullish for crude prices. \u00a0Geopolitical tensions in Europe escalated last Wednesday after Poland shot down Russian drones that crossed into its territory in Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine. \u00a0Also, Israel last Tuesday launched a strike on Doha, Qatar, targeting the senior leadership of Hamas. \u00a0Qatar said the attack by Israel violated international law and threatens to widen the conflict in the Middle East, the source of about one-third of global oil supplies.Crude prices also have support after OPEC+ agreed on September 7 to raise its crude production by 137,000 bpd, starting in October. \u00a0This is less than the 547,000 bpd increase the group decided to boost output in September and August. \u00a0OPEC+ also said restarting the remainder of the 1.66 million bpd crude production it had idled will be contingent on \"evolving market conditions.\"Concerns about a global oil glut are bearish for crude prices after the International Energy Agency (IEA) last Thursday boosted its 2026 global crude surplus estimate to 3.33 million bpd, +360,000 bpd higher than anticipated in August, citing plans by OPEC+ to revive its crude production.Concerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices as OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. \u00a0OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of production capacity that is due to remain offline until late 2026. \u00a0OPEC Aug crude production rose by +400,000 bpd to 28.55 million bpd, the highest in over two years.Last Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of September 5 were -3.2% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.6% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -10.4% below the 5-year seasonal average. \u00a0US crude oil production in the week ending September 5 rose by +0.5% w/w to 13.495 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12/6/2024.Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in

The market is trading just under the 50-day moving average of $64.21, with prices last seen near $64.12. Although buyers briefly pierced a key pivot at $64.56 on Tuesday, the rally lost steam at $64.76, capping further upside for now.Despite the mild pullback, prices remain supported above the 200-day moving average at $63.33, which continues to serve as a critical technical floor. A decisive move back above $64.76 could trigger renewed buying interest, potentially driving prices toward the next resistance zone between $65.41 and $66.18, with the September 2 high at $66.03 sitting inside that band.At 09:45 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures\u00a0are trading $64.12, down $0.40 or -0.62%.While price action has cooled, geopolitical tensions continue to underpin the market. Recent Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure have raised concerns about potential supply disruptions. Russia\u2019s Transneft reportedly warned producers that output cuts may be required if export facilities remain compromised.Analysts suggest that if the drone-related damage proves temporary, oil may return to a $5-per-barrel trading range. However, for now, the risk of further disruptions has introduced a bullish risk premium, helping limit downside pressure on prices.The crude market is also closely watching the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decision expected later today. Markets are pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut, which could lower borrowing costs and potentially boost fuel demand in the coming months.Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva highlighted that the rate cut, along with geopolitical risk and tight distillate inventories, has supported recent price strength. However, she cautioned that OPEC+ output increases and persistent global supply concerns could keep a lid on sustained rallies.On the supply side, preliminary American Petroleum Institute (API) data showed a decline in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories, but a rise in distillate stocks. The official Energy Information Administration (EIA) data due later today will offer clearer insight. According to a Reuters poll, analysts expect a crude draw alongside builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. However, a consensus of analysts polled by Dow Jones predict a 1.4 million barrel build.Light crude remains technically supported above the 200-day moving average, while geopolitical risk and expectations for a Fed rate cut offer fundamental backing. However, failure to reclaim $64.76 and pressure from rising OPEC+ output tempers bullish conviction. Unless EIA data shows a surprise build, the outlook leans cautiously bullish in the near term.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Recent disruptions at a major Russian refinery, with capacity of 355,000 barrels per day, and earlier damage to an export hub handling up to 1 million bpd, underscored vulnerability in global supply chains.Meanwhile, reports of potential EU sanctions on firms linked to Russian oil flows added further uncertainty. Traders are also watching for a possible Federal Reserve rate cut, which could lift fuel demand, keeping oil and gas markets finely balanced between risk and opportunity.Natural gas is trading at $3.02, holding above its rising trendline that\u2019s been intact since late August. The 50-EMA at $3.01 is acting as immediate support, while the 200-EMA at $3.06 is capping upside momentum, creating a narrow squeeze zone.

This attack was described as the most damaging to date in Russia\u2019s northwest, which triggered fires that halted operations. This loss of output comes at a time when oil markets are already tight, potentially reducing refined product availability and pushing prices higher.In addition to the refinery outage, Ukrainian forces damaged two tankers and key infrastructure at the Primorsk oil terminal. Although partial operations have resumed, loading capacity may remain down by as much as 50%, significantly slowing Russia\u2019s crude exports. With Primorsk handling up to 1 million barrels per day, even a temporary disruption can send ripple effects through global oil supply chains.Oil traders now face rising uncertainty over Russian exports through the Baltic. As loading schedules are delayed and infrastructure repairs continue, supply risks are intensifying just as seasonal demand begins to rise. If Ukraine continues targeting critical energy infrastructure, markets could experience sustained upward pressure on oil prices amid fears of prolonged export disruptions.The daily chart for WTI crude oil (CL) shows a rebound from the support of the ascending channel pattern. The $60 to $55.50 range remains a key long-term support zone, where prices are currently consolidating. However, the 50-day SMA remains below the 200-day SMA, indicating ongoing bearish pressure.A break above the 200-day SMA near the $67 level could trigger a strong rebound toward the $75\u2013$77 region.

This is supported by the formation of a double bottom around the $55 region in April and May 2025. A break above the $65 level would signal another rebound, with upside targets toward the $75 region in WTI crude oil.The 4-hour chart for WTI crude further highlights the bullish price action, as the price is consolidating within the edge of a triangle pattern. A break above $65 would signal further upside, while a break below $61.60 would invalidate the triangle and resume the downward trend.The daily chart for natural gas (NG) shows that prices are forming a bullish price action above the $2.60 level. A strong rebound from the neckline of the cup-and-handle pattern suggests that natural gas is gaining bullish momentum.This bullish momentum indicates that further upside is likely toward the 200-day SMA resistance near $3.60. Additionally, the RSI is approaching the 50 level, reinforcing the potential for continued gains.The 4-hour chart for natural gas shows a strong bullish price action forming above the $2.60 area. A break above $3.18 will signal further upside in natural gas prices, while a break below $2.60 would suggest a continuation of the downtrend.The daily chart for the US Dollar Index shows that it has broken below the bear flag pattern and is continuing its downward momentum. Consolidation below the 50-day SMA suggests the index is poised for a significant decline. Moreover, the RSI remains below the mid-level, indicating further downside potential for the US dollar.The 4-hour chart for the US Dollar Index shows that it is approaching the support level at 97.20. A break below this level would end the one-month consolidation and signal further downside, confirming continued bearish price action.Muhammad Umair is a finance MBA and engineering PhD.

This is a market that\u2019s been going sideways for a while, and it looks like we are paying close attention to the $60 level, extending all the way to the $62 level for significant support. All things being equal, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noisy sideways action as we are trying to form some type of bottom.That being said though, if we were to break down below the $60 level, then you can see this market really start to plunge.

A Ukrainian drone strike that disrupted loadings at Russia\u2019s Primorsk port contributed to the week\u2019s strength, raising concerns over Russian export flows. However, gains were ultimately constrained by soft U.S. economic data, rising inventories, and ongoing concerns about oversupply, keeping overall sentiment cautious.Despite the higher close for the week, the market finished on the weakside of the 52-week moving average at $63.45 for the second week in a row. This indicator is controlling the longer-term direction of the market.A sustained move under the 52-week moving average will signal the presence of sellers. If this generates enough downside momentum then look for a drive toward the swing bottom at $61.12, followed by a Fibonacci level at $60.26. The latter is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the downside.Overcoming the 52-week moving average will indicate the return of buyers. However, the subsequent rally could be a labored event with a pair of pivots at $64.56 and $65.41 providing resistance initially, followed by the swing top at $66.03. This top is a potential trigger point for a surge into $68.70.Friday\u2019s price uptick was driven by reports that a Ukrainian drone attack had suspended crude loadings at one of Russia\u2019s largest western ports. Analysts warned this could curtail Russian crude and refined product exports, injecting new volatility into the supply side. The market also remains alert to potential secondary sanctions or tariffs from the U.S. aimed at reducing Russian oil exports to India and China, the two largest buyers of Moscow\u2019s seaborne crude.However, geopolitical support was fleeting. Brent and WTI benchmarks fell sharply on Thursday, down 1.7% and 2% respectively, underscoring market skepticism toward price rallies that aren\u2019t backed by tangible supply disruptions.Traders shifted their focus late in the week to U.S. economic indicators, which cast a shadow over demand prospects. The Labor Department\u2019s revised jobs data showed the economy had created 911,000 fewer jobs through March than previously estimated. At the same time, August\u2019s Consumer Price Index\u00a0jumped 0.4%, the largest increase since January.This combination of slower job growth and sticky inflation is raising doubts about the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to cut rates in the near term\u2014potentially stalling economic activity and curbing energy consumption.The International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a fresh warning that global oil supply would rise faster than demand this year, citing planned OPEC+ production increases. This confirms market concerns that the supply side continues to outweigh consumption. In contrast, OPEC maintained its higher demand growth projections, arguing that global economic momentum remains solid.Despite OPEC\u2019s optimistic tone, traders are increasingly positioning for a market that leans toward oversupply, especially as U.S. inventories build and refinery demand softens.India\u2019s Adani Group, the nation\u2019s largest private port operator, has banned tankers under Western sanctions from accessing its facilities. Since India is the top importer of Russian seaborne crude, this move introduces further uncertainty around global crude logistics and could restrict Moscow\u2019s ability to reroute exports under sanctions.The near-term outlook remains bearish, with traders wary of soft demand, rising U.S. inventories, and expanding OPEC+ output. While geopolitical tensions\u2014especially those affecting Russian infrastructure\u2014are preventing a deeper sell-off, they have not been enough to reverse the broader sentiment.Unless demand surprises to the upside or supply is materially disrupted, Light Crude Oil Futures are likely to remain under pressure next week, with rallies seen as selling opportunities in a market still dominated by oversupply concerns.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

However, we have a very important Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday that could cause volatility.WTI OilBrent OilThe light sweet crude oil market initially did pull back a bit during the trading session on Tuesday in the very beginning of trading, only to turn around and show signs of life again. It looks at that point in time that we are just simply going back and forth. The $62 level underneath offers support, and I think that it is a support zone that probably drops down to the $60 level. The $65 level above is going to be resistance, with the 50-day EMA between here and there going the same.So, I think we\u2019re essentially compressing and we\u2019re somewhat stuck. We do have an interest rate decision coming out of the Federal Reserve late on Wednesday that might have an influence on oil in, so much as it will have an influence on the US dollar, but I don\u2019t know if it changes anything.Brent looks very much the same. We are just simply hanging around the 50 day EMA, with the $65 level underneath offering significant support, and the $69 level above offering resistance. Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of back and forth and interest in both sides of this range. Whether or not we break out remains to be seen, but right now it just seems like a very neutral and flat market.That has been the case for quite some time in oil, although we have changed the range here and there, it\u2019s been very sideways. I just don\u2019t see anything that keeps this from repeating the same pattern.

The move triggered a fresh wave of buying, lifting prices above last week\u2019s high of $64.08.WTI is currently testing resistance at the 50-day moving average of $64.25. A clean break above this level would reinforce bullish momentum, setting the stage for a run at the long-term pivot at $64.56. Above that, upside targets include $65.41 and the September 2 main top at $66.03.Bullish sentiment was further fueled by renewed supply concerns tied to escalating Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil infrastructure. Russia\u2019s Transneft has warned producers they may need to curb output due to repeated strikes on key ports and refineries. According to Goldman Sachs, attacks have disabled around 300,000 barrels per day of refining capacity between August and mid-September.JP Morgan analysts flagged that targeting export terminals like Primorsk signals an intent to restrict Russia\u2019s global crude flows\u2014potentially increasing volatility across international oil markets. While Asian buyers continue importing Russian crude, the risk of broader disruptions adds upward pressure to near-term oil prices projections.Markets are also pricing in expectations of a rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve at its September 16\u201317 meeting. While looser monetary policy could support energy demand by lowering borrowing costs, analysts remain cautious on the broader U.S. economic outlook. Still, any dovish pivot from the Fed would likely be interpreted as a bullish catalyst for crude, particularly if coupled with signs of tightening supply.The market is also awaiting official U.S. stockpile data on Wednesday. A Reuters poll showed expectations for declines in both crude and gasoline inventories last week, while distillate stocks likely posted a small increase. If confirmed, the drawdowns would further tighten the supply picture and lend support to current price levels.WTI\u2019s move above the 200-day average and its test of the 50-day signals growing bullish momentum. A confirmed breakout above $64.56 would likely accelerate gains toward $66.03, supported by geopolitical supply risks, a potentially dovish Fed, and expected U.S. inventory draws. Near-term outlook remains bullish, with $64.25\u2013$64.56 as the critical resistance zone to watch.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Despite these challenges, the company\u2019s strategic focus on inventory depth, asset quality, and an emerging Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) business has positioned it for potential growth in the coming years.ConocoPhillips has maintained a strong financial position, demonstrating robust profitability with a P/E ratio of 12.6x and trailing twelve-month EBITDA of $25.14 billion. Analysts project earnings per share (EPS) of $6.39 for fiscal year 2025, with the company\u2019s next earnings report expected on October 30, 2025. InvestingPro subscribers have access to detailed financial health scores and comprehensive analysis, with COP currently showing a \"GOOD\" overall financial health rating. These projections reflect the company\u2019s resilience in the face of market volatility and its potential for earnings growth.The company\u2019s stock has received positive ratings from several analysts, with \"Overweight\" and \"Outperform\" ratings predominating. This optimistic outlook is underpinned by ConocoPhillips\u2019 strategic initiatives and its ability to generate substantial free cash flow (FCF) in the near future.ConocoPhillips has differentiated itself through its deep inventory and high-quality assets. The company\u2019s management has emphasized a strategy of sustainable cash returns and a focus on improving existing assets rather than pursuing aggressive mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This approach is designed to enhance operational efficiency and maximize the value of the company\u2019s current portfolio.Analysts note that this strategy could lead to higher operational efficiency and potentially stronger returns for shareholders. By prioritizing the development of its existing asset base, ConocoPhillips aims to create long-term value while maintaining financial flexibility.A key driver of investor interest in ConocoPhillips is its potential for significant free cash flow generation. The company anticipates over $6 billion in free cash flow inflection following the start-up of major projects. This projected FCF growth is expected to continue through the end of the decade, with some analysts suggesting that FCF could nearly double by 2029 under current price assumptions.ConocoPhillips\u2019 commitment to shareholder returns remains strong, with a minimum payout strategy of 30% of cash flow from operations (CFO). However, recent market volatility has led to a strategic shift, with the company now targeting a ratio closer to 45% of CFO for shareholder returns. This adjustment allows for greater flexibility in responding to market conditions while still prioritizing returns to investors.The company\u2019s counter-cyclical buyback approach, supported by a strong balance sheet with a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 0.36, further demonstrates its commitment to creating shareholder value across different market cycles. Notably, ConocoPhillips has maintained dividend payments for 55 consecutive years, with a current dividend yield of 3.3%. Want deeper insights? InvestingPro offers exclusive access to additional ProTips and comprehensive financial metrics that can help you make more informed investment decisions.ConocoPhillips is actively developing its LNG business, which is expected to be a significant contributor to future growth. This strategic move into the LNG sector diversifies the company\u2019s portfolio and positions it to capitalize on the growing global demand for cleaner energy sources.The company\u2019s project pipeline is robust, with management highlighting free cash flow growth drivers, particularly in Alaska and its LNG portfolio. These projects are expected to drive the anticipated FCF inflection and support long-term value creation for the company.While ConocoPhillips has demonstrated resilience, it faces ongoing challenges in a volatile market environment. Oil price fluctuations remain a key concern, with investor debates focusing on the sensitivity of shareholder return targets to potential drops in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices.The macroeconomic landscape presents both challenges and opportunities. ConocoPhillips\u2019 management has outlined an investment strategy that aims to balance near-term development with long-term objectives, allowing the company to invest through economic cycles while maintaining financial prudence.ConocoPhillips\u2019 shareholder return strategy, which targets a payout of approximately 45% of cash flow from operations, could face pressure in a scenario of prolonged low oil prices. If West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices were to fall to $60 per barrel or lower for an extended period, the company might be forced to reassess its return targets.Lower oil prices would directly impact cash flow generation, potentially reducing the pool of funds available for shareholder distributions. While ConocoPhillips has a strong balance sheet and has demonstrated a commitment to shareholder returns, a sustained low-price environment could lead to a reduction in dividends or share buybacks to preserve capital for core operations and strategic investments.The company\u2019s recent shift from a fixed quantum backstop to a percentage-based return strategy provides some flexibility, but it also introduces greater variability in payouts. In a bearish oil market, this could translate to lower absolute returns for shareholders, potentially impacting the stock\u2019s attractiveness to income-focused investors.As ConocoPhillips expands its Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) business, it faces several risks that could impact the success of this strategic initiative. Firstly, the LNG market is highly competitive, with established players and new entrants vying for market share. ConocoPhillips will need to navigate this competitive landscape while building its presence and securing long-term contracts.Secondly, LNG projects typically require significant capital investment and have long lead times before becoming operational. Any delays or cost overruns in these projects could strain the company\u2019s financial resources and delay the realization of expected returns. The complex nature of LNG infrastructure also exposes the company to potential technical and operational challenges.Moreover, the LNG market is subject to geopolitical risks and regulatory changes in both exporting and importing countries. Shifts in energy policies, environmental regulations, or international trade relations could impact the demand for LNG or the ability to operate in certain markets.Lastly, as the world transitions towards renewable energy sources, there is a long-term risk that demand for natural gas and LNG may not grow as projected or could even decline. This could potentially leave ConocoPhillips with stranded assets or underperforming investments in its LNG business.ConocoPhillips\u2019 strategy of prioritizing the improvement of existing assets over pursuing mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has the potential to drive significant long-term value for the company. This approach allows the company to leverage its deep knowledge of its current asset base to optimize production, reduce costs, and enhance overall operational efficiency.By focusing on existing assets, ConocoPhillips can implement advanced technologies and innovative processes to increase recovery rates and extend the productive life of its fields. This strategy often requires lower capital expenditure compared to new acquisitions or greenfield projects, potentially leading to higher returns on invested capital.Furthermore, this approach reduces the integration risks and uncertainties associated with M&A activities. ConocoPhillips can allocate resources more effectively to high-return opportunities within its portfolio, ensuring that capital is deployed where it can generate the most value. This disciplined capital allocation strategy could result in more predictable and sustainable cash flow generation over time.The company\u2019s extensive inventory depth provides a runway for organic growth without the need for costly acquisitions. As ConocoPhillips continues to optimize its existing assets, it may uncover additional reserves or identify new development opportunities within its current acreage, further enhancing the long-term value proposition for shareholders.ConocoPhillips\u2019 robust project pipeline holds significant potential for driving free cash flow (FCF) growth in the coming years. The company anticipates over $6 billion in FCF inflection following the start-up of major projects, indicating a substantial boost to cash generation capacity.The project pipeline is diverse, with growth drivers identified in strategic locations such as Alaska and within the company\u2019s LNG portfolio. This geographical and operational diversity helps to mitigate risks and provides multiple avenues for FCF growth. As these projects come online, they are expected to contribute incrementally to the company\u2019s production and revenue streams.Analysts project that ConocoPhillips\u2019 FCF could nearly double by 2029 under current price assumptions. This trajectory suggests that the company\u2019s project pipeline is not only substantial but also well-timed to capitalize on market opportunities. The phased development of these projects allows for a steady ramp-up in FCF generation, providing a sustainable growth profile.Moreover, the company\u2019s focus on high-quality assets and operational efficiency could lead to lower break-even costs for these new projects. This would enhance their profitability and FCF contribution, even in scenarios of moderate oil prices. The potential for increased FCF generation strengthens ConocoPhillips\u2019 ability to maintain its shareholder return commitments while also reinvesting in future growth opportunities.Strengths:Weaknesses:Opportunities:Threats:This analysis is based on information available up to September 17, 2025, and reflects the market conditions and analyst perspectives as of that date.Gain an edge in your investment decisions with InvestingPro\u2019s in-depth analysis and exclusive insights on COP.

Investors were also keen on the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s rate decision, set to come in at 2:00 pm ET.\u00a0By 12:20 ET, the S&P/TSX 60 index had risen higher by 4.1 points, or 0.24%. The S&P/TSX composite was higher by 61.8 points or 0.2%, having closed lower\u00a0by 0.4% at 29,315.23 on Tuesday.\u00a0The Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5% on Wednesday, citing softening economic conditions and diminished inflation pressures. The move, widely anticipated by analysts, reduces the overnight rate from 2.75%, with the Bank Rate at 2.75% and the deposit rate at 2.45%.\u00a0\u201cFirst, Canada\u2019s labour market has softened further,\u201d said BoC Governor Tiff Macklem, noting that job losses have been especially pronounced in sectors tied heavily to U.S. trade, including autos, steel, and softwood lumber.\u201cSecond, although there are still some mixed signals, on balance, recent data suggest the upward pressures on underlying inflation have diminished,\u201d he said.In response, CIBC economists Andrew Grantham and Katherine Judge pointed out, \"the press conference gave little away in terms of whether policymakers foresee further cuts ahead, making it clear that the Bank remains data dependent and will take decisions one step at a time.\" CIBC projects another 25bp rate cut in October, saying, \"in our view the economy is losing resilience and inflation will continue to be contained by the elevated unemployment rate and removal of retaliatory tariffs.\"In the U.S., the Federal Reserve is anticipated to roll out a rate cut as well, although some debate is swirling around the size of the potential reduction and how officials will view the outlook for monetary policy in the coming months.U.S. stocks mixedU.S. stocks were fairly mixed on Wednesday as investors awaited the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, looking for guidance about future monetary policy.At 12:30 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher by 256.8 points or 0.6%. Conversely, the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite dropped 109.2 points or 0.5%, and the bellwether S&P 500 index dropped 10 points or 0.15%.\u00a0The main averages on Wall Street sank in the prior session, while the U.S. dollar slipped to fresh 52-week lows \u2014 signs of caution ahead of the Fed\u2019s impending announcement.Fed policy outlook in focusThe U.S. central bank concludes its two-day policy meeting later Wednesday, and is widely expected to authorise a 25-basis-point cut, which would bring the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 4.00%-4.25%.Signs of cooling in the labor market, including slower job creation and a higher unemployment rate have reinforced expectations that the Fed will move to support growth.Traders see only a slim chance of a larger half-point move. Fed funds futures suggest policymakers could lower borrowing costs by a total of 65 to 70 basis points by year-end.Attention is squarely on the Fed\u2019s updated economic projections and its so-called dot plot, which will provide clues on the path of interest rates into 2026.Investors will also scrutinize remarks from Chair Jerome Powell for guidance on whether the central bank intends to stick with gradual easing or act more aggressively if the labor market softens further.\u201cInflation remains above target and tariffs are likely to keep it elevated in the near term, but the balance of risks are tilted towards the need for more support for the economy,\u201d analysts at ING said in a note.Crude edges downOil prices declined, handing back some of the previous session\u2019s gains on heightened concerns over disruptions in Russian production.Brent futures dropped 0.3% to $68.28 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.3% to $64.33 a barrel, as of 12:30 ET.The benchmarks settled more than 1% higher on Tuesday, climbing to two-week highs, due to concerns that Russian supplies may be disrupted following Ukraine\u2019s drone attacks on critical export ports and refineries.Oil was also encouraged by U.S. industry data showing an outsized 3.2 million barrel draw in inventories over the week to September 12. This data, from the American Petroleum Institute, usually heralds a similar reading from official inventory data, which is due later on Wednesday.Gold retreats from all-time peaksGold prices edged down from record highs ahead of the release of the Fed\u2019s rate decision and policy outlook.Lower interest rates typically boost gold by reducing its opportunity cost, weakening the dollar, and lifting its appeal as an inflation hedge and safe-haven asset.Spot gold was last down 0.06% at $3,687.59 an ounce, after hitting an all-time peak of $3,702.95 on Tuesday. U.S. gold futures for December slipped 0.7% to $3,698.80/oz.Elsewhere, analysts at Deutsche Bank raised their forecast for gold next year, saying a recent surge in the yellow metal has \"further headroom to run\" thanks partially to the prospect of easing U.S. interest rates and ongoing challenges to the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

According to InvestingPro, the stock is currently trading near its 52-week high of $163.34, reflecting strong momentum in recent months. This comprehensive analysis delves into Valero\u2019s strategic positioning, financial performance, and future prospects, offering insights for investors considering the company\u2019s stock.Valero Energy, known for its Gulf Coast-dominant footprint and pure-play refining focus, has demonstrated resilience in a challenging market environment. The company\u2019s operational excellence and cost leadership have been key drivers of its success, allowing it to capture above-average margins across market cycles.In the second quarter of 2025, Valero delivered a strong performance that surpassed market expectations. The company generated $117.5 billion in revenue over the last twelve months, with InvestingPro data showing four analysts revising their earnings estimates upward for the upcoming period. Analysts noted that the company\u2019s earnings were not only better than anticipated but also of high quality, addressing key investor concerns effectively. This robust showing positioned Valero as a leader among large-cap refiners in reporting earnings for the period.Looking ahead, analysts project earnings per share (EPS) for the fiscal year 2025 (FY1) at $8.76 and for fiscal year 2026 (FY2) at $9.81. These estimates reflect confidence in Valero\u2019s ability to maintain profitability despite market fluctuations.The refining sector has experienced significant supply and demand tightness, which has supported favorable economics for companies like Valero. Analysts anticipate this trend to continue into the latter half of 2025, potentially bolstering Valero\u2019s financial performance.Crude differentials have been a topic of particular interest, as they play a crucial role in refining profitability. Valero\u2019s management has expressed optimism regarding these differentials, suggesting potential for increased margins. The company\u2019s ability to leverage advantaged feedstocks and its access to export markets further enhance its competitive position.However, the refining market is not without challenges. Seasonal tailwinds have been diminishing, as evidenced by a downward revision in EPS estimates for the first quarter of 2025. Analysts adjusted their expectations from $0.83 to $0.40, reflecting the impact of reduced system-wide capture.Valero has been proactive in adapting to the energy transition, with significant investments in renewable diesel and growing exposure to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). These initiatives offer optionality and potential growth avenues for the company. However, the renewable fuels segment faces near-term pressures due to low Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits and Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing.The regulatory environment surrounding renewable fuels remains a critical factor for Valero\u2019s future success. Recent discussions with management have highlighted the importance of renewable diesel subsidies and the evolving landscape of environmental regulations, particularly in markets like California.Valero\u2019s commitment to operational excellence has been a cornerstone of its strategy. The company\u2019s focus on cost leadership and efficiency allows it to maintain competitiveness even in challenging market conditions. Valero benefits from its advantaged feedstocks, minimal regulatory burdens compared to peers, and strategic investments in productivity enhancements.Capital spending for 2025 is projected at $2 billion, with $1.6 billion allocated for sustaining operations and $0.4 billion for growth projects. This disciplined approach to capital allocation underscores Valero\u2019s commitment to balancing operational needs with future growth opportunities.Valero has maintained a shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation. The company targets a payout ratio of 40-50% of cash flow from operations, demonstrating its commitment to returning value to shareholders. InvestingPro analysis reveals that Valero has maintained dividend payments for 37 consecutive years, currently offering a dividend yield of 2.78%. This balanced approach allows Valero to invest in growth opportunities while providing consistent returns to investors. Want deeper insights? InvestingPro offers 14 additional tips and comprehensive metrics to help you make informed investment decisions.Analysts expect Valero to generate an average free cash flow yield of 6-7% through the 2025-2027 period, with EPS power ranging from $7 to $10 per share. This financial outlook supports the company\u2019s ability to maintain its dividend policy and potentially engage in share repurchases.The refining industry is known for its cyclical nature, with seasonal patterns affecting demand and margins. As Valero faces diminishing seasonal tailwinds, there is a risk of reduced profitability in the near term. The recent downward revision of Q1 2025 EPS estimates from $0.83 to $0.40 illustrates this challenge. If this trend continues, Valero may struggle to meet earnings expectations, potentially impacting investor confidence and stock performance.Moreover, the company\u2019s heavy reliance on Gulf Coast operations exposes it to weather-related risks, such as hurricanes, which could disrupt operations and further erode seasonal advantages. Valero will need to demonstrate its ability to navigate these seasonal fluctuations effectively to maintain investor trust.Valero\u2019s investments in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel are subject to regulatory uncertainties. Changes in renewable fuel standards, subsidy programs, or carbon credit systems could significantly impact the profitability of these ventures. For instance, the current low prices for Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits and Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) are already pressuring the economics of Valero\u2019s renewable fuel segment.Furthermore, as governments worldwide push for more aggressive climate policies, Valero may face increased compliance costs or restrictions on traditional refining operations. The company\u2019s ability to adapt to these regulatory shifts will be crucial for its long-term success, and any missteps could result in financial penalties or loss of market share to more environmentally focused competitors.Valero\u2019s reputation for operational excellence and cost leadership provides a significant competitive advantage in the current tight refining market. The company\u2019s ability to capture above-average margins across market cycles demonstrates its operational efficiency and strategic asset positioning. With supply and demand tightness expected to continue, Valero is well-positioned to capitalize on favorable refining economics.The company\u2019s focus on advantaged feedstocks and export market access further enhances its ability to optimize profitability. As global demand for refined products remains robust, Valero\u2019s efficient operations and strategic Gulf Coast footprint allow it to serve both domestic and international markets effectively. This operational flexibility could translate into sustained earnings growth and market share gains in a competitive refining landscape.Despite near-term pressures, Valero\u2019s investments in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) present significant long-term growth opportunities. As global efforts to reduce carbon emissions intensify, demand for these cleaner fuel alternatives is expected to rise. Valero\u2019s early entry into this market positions it as a leader in the transition to more sustainable energy sources.The company\u2019s existing infrastructure and expertise in fuel production and distribution provide a strong foundation for expanding its renewable fuel capabilities. As technology advances and economies of scale improve, Valero could see increasing returns from its renewable fuel investments. Additionally, potential future regulatory support for low-carbon fuels could create a more favorable economic environment for these products, driving growth and profitability in this segment of Valero\u2019s business.Strengths:Weaknesses:Opportunities:Threats:This analysis is based on information available up to September 17, 2025, and reflects the most recent analyst reports and market data provided.

The move, widely anticipated by analysts, reduces the overnight rate from 2.75%, with the Bank Rate at 2.75% and the deposit rate at 2.45%.\u00a0\u201cFirst, Canada\u2019s labour market has softened further,\u201d said BoC Governor Tiff Macklem, noting that job losses have been especially pronounced in sectors tied heavily to U.S. trade, including autos, steel, and softwood lumber.\u201cSecond, although there are still some mixed signals, on balance, recent data suggest the upward pressures on underlying inflation have diminished,\u201d he said.In response, CIBC economists Andrew Grantham and Katherine Judge pointed out, \"the press conference gave little away in terms of whether policymakers foresee further cuts ahead, making it clear that the Bank remains data dependent and will take decisions one step at a time.\" CIBC projects another 25bp rate cut in October, saying, \"in our view the economy is losing resilience and inflation will continue to be contained by the elevated unemployment rate and removal of retaliatory tariffs.\"In the U.S., the Federal Reserve is anticipated to roll out a rate cut as well, although some debate is swirling around the size of the potential reduction and how officials will view the outlook for monetary policy in the coming months.U.S. stocks mixedU.S. stocks were fairly mixed on Wednesday as investors awaited the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, looking for guidance about future monetary policy.At 12:30 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher by 256.8 points or 0.6%. Conversely, the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite dropped 109.2 points or 0.5%, and the bellwether S&P 500 index dropped 10 points or 0.15%.\u00a0The main averages on Wall Street sank in the prior session, while the U.S. dollar slipped to fresh 52-week lows \u2014 signs of caution ahead of the Fed\u2019s impending announcement.Fed policy outlook in focusThe U.S. central bank concludes its two-day policy meeting later Wednesday, and is widely expected to authorise a 25-basis-point cut, which would bring the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 4.00%-4.25%.Signs of cooling in the labor market, including slower job creation and a higher unemployment rate have reinforced expectations that the Fed will move to support growth.Traders see only a slim chance of a larger half-point move. Fed funds futures suggest policymakers could lower borrowing costs by a total of 65 to 70 basis points by year-end.Attention is squarely on the Fed\u2019s updated economic projections and its so-called dot plot, which will provide clues on the path of interest rates into 2026.Investors will also scrutinize remarks from Chair Jerome Powell for guidance on whether the central bank intends to stick with gradual easing or act more aggressively if the labor market softens further.\u201cInflation remains above target and tariffs are likely to keep it elevated in the near term, but the balance of risks are tilted towards the need for more support for the economy,\u201d analysts at ING said in a note.Crude edges downOil prices declined, handing back some of the previous session\u2019s gains on heightened concerns over disruptions in Russian production.Brent futures dropped 0.3% to $68.28 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.3% to $64.33 a barrel, as of 12:30 ET.The benchmarks settled more than 1% higher on Tuesday, climbing to two-week highs, due to concerns that Russian supplies may be disrupted following Ukraine\u2019s drone attacks on critical export ports and refineries.Oil was also encouraged by U.S. industry data showing an outsized 3.2 million barrel draw in inventories over the week to September 12. This data, from the American Petroleum Institute, usually heralds a similar reading from official inventory data, which is due later on Wednesday.Gold retreats from all-time peaksGold prices edged down from record highs ahead of the release of the Fed\u2019s rate decision and policy outlook.Lower interest rates typically boost gold by reducing its opportunity cost, weakening the dollar, and lifting its appeal as an inflation hedge and safe-haven asset.Spot gold was last down 0.06% at $3,687.59 an ounce, after hitting an all-time peak of $3,702.95 on Tuesday. U.S. gold futures for December slipped 0.7% to $3,698.80/oz.Elsewhere, analysts at Deutsche Bank raised their forecast for gold next year, saying a recent surge in the yellow metal has \"further headroom to run\" thanks partially to the prospect of easing U.S. interest rates and ongoing challenges to the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

\u00a0Reuters reported Tuesday that Russia's Transneft Pipeline, which handles more than 80% of the country's oil, has restricted the ability to store crude. \u00a0Also, the Kirishi refinery, one of Russia's biggest refineries that has an annual processing capacity of over 20 million tons, halted crude processing after damage caused by a Ukrainian drone attack on Sunday. \u00a0In addition,

Russia's crude-processing runs to 4.98 million bpd in the first three days of September, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25 years. \u00a0Crude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. \u00a0President Trump said last Friday that his patience with Russian President Putin was \"running out fast\" for continuing the war in Ukraine, and he threatened new economic sanctions against Russia. \u00a0The US proposed that the Group of Seven allies impose tariffs as high as 100% on

August. \u00a0OPEC+ also said restarting the remainder of the 1.66 million bpd crude production it had idled will be contingent on \"evolving market conditions.\" \u00a0OPEC+ is boosting output to

million bpd, +360,000 bpd higher than anticipated in August, citing plans by OPEC+ to revive its crude production.Today's weekly EIA report was mixed for crude and products. \u00a0On the negative side, EIA distillate stockpiles rose +4.0 million bbl to an 8-month high, a larger build than expectations of +1.1 million bbl. \u00a0On the positive side, EIA crude inventories unexpectedly fell by

\u00a0In addition, crude supplies at Cushing, the delivery point of WTI futures, fell by -296,000 bbl. \u00a0Today's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of September 12 were -4.7%

gasoline prices were under pressure on Wednesday from energy demand concerns. \u00a0Wednesday's weaker-than-expected US housing starts and building permits reports were bearish for the economy and energy demand. \u00a0Losses in crude were limited after weekly EIA crude inventories and gasoline supplies fell more than expected. \u00a0In a negative factor for energy demand and crude prices, Aug US housing starts fell -8.5% m/m to 1.307 million, weaker than expectations of 1.365 million. \u00a0Also, Aug building permits, a proxy for future construction, unexpectedly fell -3.7% m/m to a 5.25-year low of 1.312 million, weaker than expectations of an increase to 1.370 million.Ukraine has stepped up its attacks on Russian refineries and oil infrastructure, which is bullish for crude prices as it curbs Russian crude exports and tightens global oil supplies. \u00a0Reuters reported Tuesday that Russia's Transneft Pipeline, which handles more than 80% of the country's oil, has restricted the ability to store crude. \u00a0Also, the Kirishi refinery, one of Russia's biggest refineries that has an annual processing capacity of over 20 million tons, halted crude processing after damage caused by a Ukrainian drone attack on Sunday. \u00a0In addition, Ukrainian drone attacks have damaged Russian oil infrastructure and crude-exporting hubs along Russia's Baltic Coast. \u00a0Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries have curbed Russia's crude-processing runs to 4.98 million bpd in the first three days of September, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25 years. \u00a0Crude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. \u00a0President Trump said last Friday that his patience with Russian President Putin was \"running out fast\" for continuing the war in Ukraine, and he threatened new economic sanctions against Russia. \u00a0The US

67.96 million bbl in the week ended September 12.Crude prices also have support after OPEC+ agreed on September 7 to raise its crude production by 137,000 bpd, starting in October. \u00a0This is less than the 547,000 bpd increase the group decided to boost output in September and August. \u00a0OPEC+ also said restarting the remainder of the 1.66 million bpd crude production it had idled will be contingent on \"evolving market conditions.\" \u00a0OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. \u00a0OPEC Aug crude production rose by +400,000 bpd to 28.55 million bpd, the highest in over two years.Concerns about a global oil glut are bearish for crude prices after the International Energy Agency (IEA) last Thursday boosted its 2026 global crude surplus estimate to 3.33 million bpd, +360,000 bpd higher than anticipated in August, citing plans by OPEC+ to revive its crude production.Wednesday's weekly EIA report was mixed for crude and products. \u00a0On the negative side, EIA distillate stockpiles rose +4.0 million bbl to an 8-month high, a larger build than expectations of +1.1 million bbl. \u00a0On the positive side, EIA crude inventories unexpectedly fell by -9.29 million bbl versus expectations of a +1.75 million bbl build. \u00a0Also, EIA gasoline supplies unexpectedly fell -2.4 million bl to a 9-month low versus expectations of a +675,000 bbl build. \u00a0In addition, crude supplies at Cushing, the delivery point of WTI futures, fell by -296,000 bbl. \u00a0Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of September 12 were -4.7% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -1.6% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -7.4% below the 5-year seasonal average. \u00a0US crude oil production in the week ending September 12 fell by -0.1% w/w to 13.482 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12/6/2024.Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending September 12 rose by +2 to 416 rigs, just above the 4-year low of 410 rigs from August 1. \u00a0Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year high of 627 rigs reported in

Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 tacked on 1%.Global stocks stumbled on Wednesday after hitting a record high in the wake of the Fed\u2019s quarter-point rate cut and indications it would steadily lower borrowing costs for the rest of this year.However, in post-meeting comments, Fed Chair Jerome Powell tempered the more aggressive easing expectations in markets, saying Wednesday\u2019s move was a risk-management cut and the central bank did not need to move quickly on rates.\"All told, we\u2019d describe the decision and tone of the press conference as balanced and restrained, and not at all dovish,\" ANZ analysts said in a note.\"Powell\u2019s focus on stronger U.S. GDP forecasts and still elevated inflation projections seemed to create doubt in investors\u2019 minds.\"Those doubts fed into U.S. trading overnight, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite closing down.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 10 cents, or 0.16%, at $63.95.The Federal Reserve cut is policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday and indicated it will steadily lower borrowing costs over the rest of the year, as policymakers responded to signs of weakness in the jobs market.Lower borrowing costs typically boost demand for oil.The indication of more cuts signals the Fed assesses risk to the economy from unemployment to be significantly higher than from inflation, Claudio Galimberti, chief economist and global director of market analysis at Rystad Energy, said in a client note.\"For Brent in particular ... the cut and the two expected by the end of the year will be a bullish factor, which will in part counter the bearish OPEC+ unwinding strategy,\" he said, referring to increased oil supply from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies.On the demand side, U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell sharply last week as net imports dropped to a record low while exports jumped to a near two-year high, showed data from the Energy Information Administration.However, a rise in distillate stockpiles by 4 million barrels, versus market expectations of 1 million barrels, raised concern about demand in the world\u2019s top oil consumer, pressuring prices.Overall, global oil demand averaged 104.4 million barrels per day (mpd) through September 17, a year-over-year rise of 0.520 mbd, JP Morgan said in a client note.

reversed higher Tuesday, reclaiming key averages and breaking out of a falling wedge, shifting momentum bullish and setting up a test of higher resistance.WTI OilCrude oil flipped the script on Tuesday. What looked like a bearish breakdown last week has now morphed into a sharp bullish reversal. Prices surged to a nine-day high of $64.90, erasing the downside implications of a failed bear flag. False moves often fuel fast moves, and crude\u2019s rally fits that mold. A strong close above $64.36 would confirm the breakout reversal and mark a decisive shift in momentum.The bulls scored two technical victories today. First, they reclaimed the 20-Day moving average at $64.02 \u2014 a level that has repeatedly capped rallies in recent weeks. More importantly, crude broke out of a falling wedge pattern at the same time it cleared the short-term range. Wedge breakouts are often early warning signs that a trend is turning, and this one is flashing in favor of higher prices.The next battle zone lies near the 50-Day average, currently $65.41. This level carries added weight thanks to an anchored VWAP from the April 9 low, sitting at the same price. A close above this dual resistance would further validate the reversal, opening the way for a push toward $66.53 \u2014 a swing high that aligns with the 50% retracement of the recent decline. Beyond that, the 200-Day average at $67.48 marks a logical upside target.Failed bearish setups can be powerful fuel for rallies, and crude\u2019s current bounce is a textbook example. Shorts caught on the wrong side may be forced to cover, providing additional buying pressure. With momentum shifting, the top boundary of the broader falling channel comes back into play as a potential medium-term target.The reversal is not just a daily story \u2014 it\u2019s showing up on the weekly chart too. A weekly bullish reversal highlights stronger demand on a larger scale and improves the probability of further gains. While upside follow-through is essential, the weight of evidence now tilts bullish, with multiple signs pointing to higher prices ahead.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar.

The $62 level underneath is significant support and the $65 level above is significant resistance.

Ultimately, this is a market that I think you need to pay close attention to these levels, and we\u2019ll see how this plays out.But right now, I think oil is trying to find its basing pattern, its range, if you will, for the time of year. After all, there are a lot of concerns about global growth. So, I think that and the oversupply coming out of OPEC, Russia and the United States keeps markets suppressed a bit, but there is a certain level where drilling for oil no longer becomes sensible to do. So obviously, we can\u2019t get crushed. More things lead me in the direction in this market of thinking sideways than anything else.Brent markets look very much sideways as well, with the $65 level offering significant support and the $69 level offering significant resistance.

up +0.61 (+0.97%), and October RBOB gasoline (RBV25) closed up +0.0280 (+1.41%).Crude oil and gasoline prices settled higher on Monday, with gasoline posting a 1-week high. \u00a0Monday's weaker dollar was supportive for energy prices. \u00a0Also, concerns over a decline in Russian oil exports are boosting prices after Ukraine stepped up its drone attacks on Russian refineries. \u00a0In addition, Monday's rally in the S&P 500 to a new record high shows confidence in the economic outlook and is supportive of energy demand and crude prices. \u00a0Gains in crude were limited after Monday's weaker-than-expected US and Chinese economic news signaled weakness in energy demand.Ukraine has stepped up its attacks on Russian refineries and oil infrastructure, which is bullish for crude prices as it curbs Russian crude exports and tightens global oil supplies. \u00a0The Kirishi refinery, one of Russia's biggest refineries that has an annual processing capacity of over 20 million tons, halted crude processing after damage caused by a Ukrainian drone attack on Sunday. \u00a0Also, Ukrainian drone attacks have damaged Russian oil infrastructure and crude-exporting hubs along Russia's Baltic Coast. \u00a0Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries have curbed Russia's crude-processing runs to 4.98 million bpd in the first three days of September, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25 years. \u00a0Monday's weaker-than-expected global economic news is bearish for energy demand and crude prices. \u00a0The US Sep Empire manufacturing survey of general business conditions fell -20.6 to a three-month low of -8.7, weaker than expectations of 5.0. \u00a0Also, China's Aug industrial production rose +5.2% y/y, weaker than expectations of +5.6% y/y. \u00a0In addition, the China Aug surveyed jobless rate unexpectedly rose +0.1 to a 6-month high of 5.3%, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of no change at 5.2%.A decrease in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bullish for oil prices. \u00a0Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days fell by -7.2% w/w to 67.96 million bbl in the week ended September 12.Crude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. \u00a0President Trump said last Friday that his patience with Russian President Putin was \"running out fast\" for continuing the war in Ukraine, and he threatened new economic sanctions against Russia. \u00a0The US proposed that the Group of Seven allies impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil in an effort to convince Russia to end the war in Ukraine.Escalation of geopolitical risks in Europe and the Middle East is bullish for crude prices. \u00a0Geopolitical tensions in Europe escalated last Wednesday after Poland shot down Russian drones that crossed into its territory in Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine. \u00a0Also, Israel last Tuesday launched a strike on Doha, Qatar, targeting the senior leadership of Hamas. \u00a0Qatar said the attack by Israel violated international law and threatens to widen the conflict in the Middle East, the source of about one-third of global oil supplies.Crude prices also have support after OPEC+ agreed on September 7 to raise its crude production by 137,000 bpd, starting in October. \u00a0This is less than the 547,000 bpd increase the group decided to boost output in September and August. \u00a0OPEC+ also said restarting the remainder of the 1.66 million bpd crude production it had idled will be contingent on \"evolving market conditions.\"Concerns about a global oil glut are bearish for crude prices after the International Energy Agency (IEA) last Thursday boosted its 2026 global crude surplus estimate to 3.33 million bpd, +360,000 bpd higher than anticipated in August, citing plans by OPEC+ to revive its crude production.Concerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices as OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. \u00a0OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of production capacity that is due to remain offline until late 2026. \u00a0OPEC Aug crude production rose by +400,000 bpd to 28.55 million bpd, the highest in over two years.Last Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of September 5 were -3.2% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.6% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -10.4% below the 5-year seasonal average. \u00a0US crude oil production in the week ending September 5 rose by +0.5% w/w to 13.495 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12/6/2024.Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending September 12 rose by +2 to 416 rigs, just above the 4-year low of 410 rigs from August 1. \u00a0Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.\u00a0", "analysis": 2}, "264": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil News: Crude Oil Slips Below 50-Day MA Ahead

government\u2019s weekly inventory report. The market is trading just under the 50-day moving average of $64.21, with prices last seen near $64.12. Although buyers briefly pierced a key pivot at $64.56 on Tuesday, the rally lost steam at $64.76, capping further upside for now.Despite the mild pullback, prices remain supported above the 200-day moving average at $63.33, which continues to serve as a critical technical floor. A decisive move back above $64.76 could trigger renewed buying interest, potentially driving prices toward the next resistance zone between $65.41 and $66.18, with the September 2 high at $66.03 sitting inside that band.At 09:45 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures\u00a0are trading $64.12, down $0.40 or -0.62%.While price action has cooled, geopolitical tensions continue to underpin the market. Recent Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure have raised concerns about potential supply disruptions. Russia\u2019s Transneft reportedly warned producers that output cuts may be required if export facilities remain compromised.Analysts suggest that if the drone-related damage proves temporary, oil may return to a $5-per-barrel trading range. However, for now, the risk of further disruptions has introduced a bullish risk premium, helping limit downside pressure on prices.The crude market is also closely watching the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decision expected later today. Markets are pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut, which could lower borrowing costs and potentially boost fuel demand in the coming months.Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva highlighted that the rate cut, along with geopolitical risk and tight distillate inventories, has supported recent price strength. However, she cautioned that OPEC+ output increases and persistent global supply concerns could keep a lid on sustained rallies.On the supply side, preliminary American Petroleum Institute (API) data showed a decline in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories, but a rise in distillate stocks. The official Energy Information Administration (EIA) data due later today will offer clearer insight. According to a Reuters poll, analysts expect a crude draw alongside builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. However, a consensus of analysts polled by Dow Jones predict a 1.4 million barrel build.Light crude remains technically supported above the 200-day moving average, while geopolitical risk and expectations for a Fed rate cut offer fundamental backing. However, failure to reclaim $64.76 and pressure from rising OPEC+ output tempers bullish conviction. Unless EIA data shows a surprise build, the outlook leans cautiously bullish in the near term.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 260 points, or 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%.The swings came after the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate for the first time this year. That move was no surprise for Wall Street, which was widely expecting it. More important was the set of projections that Fed officials published showing where they expect interest rates to go in upcoming years.That indicated the typical member sees the Fed cutting the federal funds rate two more times by the end of this year and once more in 2026.Stocks initially rose following the release of the projections, which seemed to support Wall Street\u2019s widespread expectation for more cuts to interest rates. Such moves can give the economy a kickstart, and stock prices had already run to records on the bet that several cuts are on the way.But stocks gave back gains after Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed that they\u2019re only projections. Conditions could change quickly, and Powell warned against taking the projections as gospel.What\u2019s making things difficult for the Fed is that the job market is slowing as inflation is remaining stubbornly high. The Fed is in charge of fixing both, but it has only one tool to do that. And helping one by moving interest rates often hurts the other in the short term.The Fed had been holding rates steady this year because of the threat that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will raise prices for all kinds of products.

This attack was described as the most damaging to date in Russia\u2019s northwest, which triggered fires that halted operations. This loss of output comes at a time when oil markets are already tight, potentially reducing refined product availability and pushing prices higher.In addition to the refinery outage, Ukrainian forces damaged two tankers and key infrastructure at the Primorsk oil terminal. Although partial operations have resumed, loading capacity may remain down by as much as 50%, significantly slowing Russia\u2019s crude exports. With Primorsk handling up to 1 million barrels per day, even a temporary disruption can send ripple effects through global oil supply chains.Oil traders now face rising uncertainty over Russian exports through the Baltic.

Additionally, the RSI is approaching the 50 level, reinforcing the potential for continued gains.The 4-hour chart for natural gas shows a strong bullish price action forming above the $2.60 area. A break above $3.18 will signal further upside in natural gas prices, while a break below $2.60 would suggest a continuation of the downtrend.The daily chart for the US Dollar Index shows that it has broken below the bear flag pattern and is continuing its downward momentum.

Its key components are agreed with Putin beforehand and are unlikely to be significantly altered during the formal parliamentary debate.Russia, in the fourth year of its war in Ukraine, has raised personal income and corporate taxes this year, but the government still had to triple its federal budget deficit estimate to 1.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in May.It is now set to exceed that target, according to an unnamed official quoted by state media this month. The 0.9% of GDP deficit for 2026 included in a budget law last year also looks likely to be exceeded.INCREASE COULD HALVE THE PROJECTED BUDGET DEFICITFour sources close to the government confirmed a report this week by The Bell, a media outlet based outside Russia, that the government is discussing lifting the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 22% from 20% to curb the deficit.The report did not specify a possible timeline for a decision but one of the sources told Reuters it was being considered for the 2026 budget as long as the budget rule which sets aside windfall oil revenues remains in place.\"How can the deficit be reduced while adhering to the budget rule? Only by raising taxes, because there\u2019s hardly anything left to cut, either military spending or social spending,\" one source said.VAT accounted for 37% of federal budget revenues in 2024 and the possible increase could halve the projected 2026 deficit, according to Reuters calculations.Russia\u2019s economy has continued to grow despite tightening Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine. But GDP is expected to slow to around 1% from 4.3% last year and inflation remains above 8% in a country where much of the workforce and 40% of revenues now go to defence and security.Government spending is the key driver of economic growth in Russia, and with Putin expressing displeasure at the economic slowdown and the need to continue financing the war of attrition in Ukraine, spending cuts are unlikely.NO FINAL DECISION YETFinance Minister Anton Siluanov has insisted that the budget rule, under which energy revenues collected above Russia\u2019s target oil price, currently $60 per barrel, are directed to the fiscal reserve fund, will remain in place.After Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, Western nations prohibited insurers and maritime service providers from facilitating Russian oil exports unless they were below $60 a barrel. India boosted its Russian oil imports sharply but now faces pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to halt them.The Russian fund, which is separate to the country\u2019s central bank reserves, currently has about 4 trillion roubles in liquid assets, which can also be used to cover the deficit. This year the government plans to tap the fund for 447 billion roubles.Putin, who in 2024 pledged no major changes to the tax system before 2030 following the tax hikes, which were introduced in 2025, has asked the government on September 5 to increase revenues through higher productivity, not taxes.The source who said there was little room for cuts in the federal budget, argued that military spending could not be cut and minor cuts in the social sphere would not help much.\"It is like shearing a piglet\u2014lots of squealing, not much use. If we could cut 1\u20132 trillion roubles, sure, but you can\u2019t cut amounts like that, they just aren\u2019t there. You can trim a few million, maybe hundreds,\" the source said.GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE BUDGETA two percentage point 2019 VAT hike contributed 0.6 percentage points to inflation that year, according to the central bank, which has pledged to halve inflation to return it to its 4% target.However, central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina cautiously backed a tax increase, saying after the September 12 board meeting that it was better to raise extra revenue than to widen the deficit.She linked the size of the deficit to the central bank\u2019s ability to cut rates further from the current 17%, a level economists see as too high to revive growth.Putin has said that Russia\u2019s low level of debt allows it to borrow more and that new debt should not be feared, but rates even for the government are around 13%, with interest expenses expected to reach 2% of GDP in 2025.

A Ukrainian drone strike that disrupted loadings at Russia\u2019s Primorsk port contributed to the week\u2019s strength, raising concerns over Russian export flows. However, gains were ultimately constrained by soft U.S. economic data, rising inventories, and ongoing concerns about oversupply, keeping overall sentiment cautious.Despite the higher close for the week, the market finished on the weakside of the 52-week moving average at $63.45 for the second week in a row. This indicator is controlling the longer-term direction of the market.A sustained move under the 52-week moving average will signal the presence of sellers. If this generates enough downside momentum then look for a drive toward the swing bottom at $61.12, followed by a Fibonacci level at $60.26. The latter is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the downside.Overcoming the 52-week moving average will indicate the return of buyers. However, the subsequent rally could be a labored event with a pair of pivots at $64.56 and $65.41 providing resistance initially, followed by the swing top at $66.03. This top is a potential trigger point for a surge into $68.70.Friday\u2019s price uptick was driven by reports that a Ukrainian drone attack had suspended crude loadings at one of Russia\u2019s largest western ports. Analysts warned this could curtail Russian crude and refined product exports, injecting new volatility into the supply side. The market also remains alert to potential secondary sanctions or tariffs from the U.S. aimed at reducing Russian oil exports to India and China, the two largest buyers of Moscow\u2019s seaborne crude.However, geopolitical support was fleeting. Brent and WTI benchmarks fell sharply on Thursday, down 1.7% and 2% respectively, underscoring market skepticism toward price rallies that aren\u2019t backed by tangible supply disruptions.Traders shifted their focus late in the week to U.S. economic indicators, which cast a shadow over demand prospects. The Labor Department\u2019s revised jobs data showed the economy had created 911,000 fewer jobs through March than previously estimated. At the same time, August\u2019s Consumer Price Index\u00a0jumped 0.4%, the largest increase since January.This combination of slower job growth and sticky inflation is raising doubts about the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to cut rates in the near term\u2014potentially stalling economic activity and curbing energy consumption.The International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a fresh warning that global oil supply would rise faster than demand this year, citing planned OPEC+ production increases. This confirms market concerns that the supply side continues to outweigh consumption. In contrast, OPEC maintained its higher demand growth projections, arguing that global economic momentum remains solid.Despite OPEC\u2019s optimistic tone, traders are increasingly positioning for a market that leans toward oversupply, especially as U.S. inventories build and refinery demand softens.India\u2019s Adani Group, the nation\u2019s largest private port operator, has banned tankers under Western sanctions from accessing its facilities. Since India is the top importer of Russian seaborne crude, this move introduces further uncertainty around global crude logistics and could restrict Moscow\u2019s ability to reroute exports under sanctions.The near-term outlook remains bearish, with traders wary of soft demand, rising U.S. inventories, and expanding OPEC+ output. While geopolitical tensions\u2014especially those affecting Russian infrastructure\u2014are preventing a deeper sell-off, they have not been enough to reverse the broader sentiment.Unless demand surprises to the upside or supply is materially disrupted, Light Crude Oil Futures are likely to remain under pressure next week, with rallies seen as selling opportunities in a market still dominated by oversupply concerns.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.
