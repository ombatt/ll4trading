The more active contract for November finished down 53 cents, or 0.78%, at $67.45.West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled at $64.01, down 59 cents, or 0.91%.The market was in part shifting its focus toward next week\u2019s OPEC+ meeting, said Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates.Crude output has increased from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, as the group has accelerated output hikes to regain market share, raising the supply outlook and weighing on global oil prices.\"Overall, the bottom line is we\u2019re going to see a jump in supply feeding into a lackluster demand market,\" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.The U.S. summer driving season ends on Monday\u2019s Labor Day holiday, signalling the end of the highest demand period in the United States, which is the largest fuel market.\"The market is beginning to wonder what effect the tariffs might have on the economic outlook next year,\" Lipow said, referring to tariffs imposed by the administration of President Donald Trump on U.S. imports from many trading partners.Crude supply increases have not made their way into the U.S. market yet, raising the possibility supply and demand will be in a tighter balance, said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.\"The pessimism about demand, I\u2019m just not seeing it,\" Flynn said. \"Supply from OPEC is supposed to increase, but we\u2019re not seeing it in the U.S. I think things are going to stay tight.\"Prices rose earlier in the week due to Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil export terminals, but reports of talks between Ukraine\u2019s European allies about a possible ceasefire helped tamp down prices, Flynn said.U.S. crude inventories for the week ending August 22 showed higher-than-expected draws, implying late-summer demand was still firm, particularly in industrial and freight-related sectors, analyst Ole Hvalbye at SEB bank said in a note. [EIA/S]Investors are also watching for India\u2019s response to pressure from the United States to stop buying Russian oil, after Trump doubled tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50% on Wednesday.So far, India has defied the U.S. and Russian oil exports to India are set to rise in September, traders said.\"The prevalent view is that Russian sanctions are not forthcoming, and India will ignore U.S. sanction threats and continue buying Russian crude oil at heavily discounted prices,\" PVM\u2019s Varga said.The best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said:\u201cProposals reportedly under consideration include a new levy to replace stamp duty on the sale of homes worth more than \u00a3500,000, while owners of high value homes may be hit with capital gains tax bills even if the property is their primary residence. An overhaul of the council tax system is also being mulled, while buy-to-let landlords are also in the spotlight with reports suggesting National Insurance could be applied to rental income\u201cSuch changes could unsettle buyers, homeowners and buy-to-let landlords alike. The idea of charging CGT on the sales of a primary residence challenges the long-held belief that owning the home you live in keeps the taxman at bay. Combined with a levy on high-value home sales, these proposals risk grinding the market to a halt, as homeowners reconsider the cost of moving.\u201cFor landlords, the prospect of further tax changes could erode the appeal of buy-to-let investing once and for all. Many are already grappling with tighter regulations and a higher tax burden, so another tax raid could prompt more landlords to sell up, potentially driving up rents as supply shrinks.\u201cLooking ahead, uncertainty around future tax policy combined with a growing stock of homes on the market may continue to temper price growth, potentially improving affordability across the market. Affordability has improved since the Bank of England began cutting rates in August last year, though stubborn inflation continues to cloud the outlook for further cuts.Jonathan Hopper, CEO of Garrington Property Finders, said:\u201cTwo factors are combining to hold prices down: a flood of supply which has made this a buyer\u2019s market and a \u2018back-to-school\u2019 reality check among sellers. Lesson one is a crash course in economics - and the power of supply and demand.\u201cDeals are being done, but in many parts of the country there are many more sellers than serious buyers, and this is allowing buyers to take their time and negotiate hard on price.\u201cIn response sellers are being forced to price their homes keenly just to get potential buyers through the door. And when it comes to agreeing a price, buyers often hold the strongest cards - even if buyers are behaving differently at different price points.\u201cWhile interest rate-sensitive purchasers such as first-time buyers remain very active, discretionary buyers higher up the property ladder are starting to adopt a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach in response to reports of potential tax reforms in the Autumn Budget.\u201cThe August cut in the base rate has yet to introduce any extra zip to the market, and we\u2019re likely to see property prices drag over the next few months.\u201cIn the absence of confidence and clarity, buyers\u2019 offers will reflect the unknown risks in what they are willing to pay. Deals will be done, but only pragmatic sellers are likely to be successful in what is set to remain a very price sensitive autumn market.\u201dAhead of the UK PMI reading, Boudewijn Driedonks, partner at McKinsey & Company, had this to say (based on the flash figures):\"August\u2019s burst of growth has the ring of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, echoing 2024\u2019s fragile rebound.\u201cThe faster pace of growth seen in the Eurozone and UK in August is positive, but the veneer of long-term growth momentum remains thin. Achieving that is less straight-forward, particularly as economic sentiment has just slipped in Europe and political uncertainty in France and Norway is adding fresh instability.\u201cThe services sector in the UK, which makes up about 73% of UK GDP, powered growth in August, fuelled by brighter business sentiment and its immunity from tariffs. But, with UK manufacturing dropping further under the 50.0 growth threshold, there is no sign of improving competitiveness in the goods export industry. To achieve long-term growth, the UK will need to consider how it boosts its competitiveness \u2013 with AI, new trade deals and defence providing new opportunities.\u201cEurope paints the polar opposite picture. Its growth was driven by manufacturing. It rose above the growth threshold to 50.5, from 49.8 in July, driven by better-than-expected performance from Germany. Its service sector, whilst not in decline, did see a slower pace of growth. Sentiment however is waning, pointing to the fragility of the newfound ground.\u201cMoving into September, business growth will need to head off a volatile mix of political uncertainty and declining economic sentiment. Business leaders will need to be proactive to maintain the momentum we\u2019ve seen in August.\u201dYahoo Finance UK's Pedro Goncalves logged on early to cover this one:UK house prices dropped in August as households are still struggling to secure a deposit and amid high monthly mortgage payments, according to lender Nationwide.On a monthly basis, house prices slipped 0.1%, after seasonal adjustments.

That\u2019s a risk we cannot take. We need both oil and gas and renewable energy.\u201dEstimates suggest that up to 15bn barrels of oil and gas will be needed between now and 2050, even in the event of Britain\u2019s net zero goals being met.He said UK producers are currently on track to meet only 4bn barrels of that demand.OEUK pitched proposals to the Treasury for replacing the EPL with a permanent mechanism that would be activated only when both oil and gas prices exceeded a set threshold.While that would mean a \u00a36bn hit to short-term tax receipts, the lobby group said it would deliver far more to the public coffers in the longer term by sustaining the offshore industry through the transition to renewables.It said the proposals would secure \u00a341bn of extra investment for UK energy by 2050, deliver \u00a312bn in additional tax receipts and provide a \u00a3137bn boost to the economy, and at the same time support 23,000 offshore jobs.Mr Whitehouse said oil and gas operators would still pay higher taxes when prices were high, while knowing that the levy would be adjusted were they to drop.The plea from the oil industry comes as Kemi Badenoch prepares to commit to extracting as much oil and gas from the North Sea as possible.", "analysis": 2}, "19": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil Stays in Tight Range Amid Russian Supply Risks, Rising OPEC+ Output", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3c775f08-2b9a-3f5f-9bad-a401e25eda6d/oil-stays-in-tight-range-amid.html", "date": "2025-09-01T07:42:00.000Z", "body": "Oil prices continued to hold in a tight range, as the market weighs prospects of an impending supply surplus against fading hopes for a near-term ceasefire in Ukraine.", "analysis": 2}, "20": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil dips as Putin and Xi meet at SCO summit in China", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-gold-pound-dollar-latest-091708818.html", "date": "2025-09-01T09:17:08.000Z", "body": "Oil futures contracts ticked up on Monday morning, gaining as China hosted countries from across Asia and the Middle East at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin.Among topics on the agenda were trade and the Russia-Ukraine war \u2013 both of which have an ongoing impact on the viscose commodity.

It is expected that supplies will reach the planned capacity of 38 bcm this year.In February 2022, China also agreed to buy up to 10 bcm of gas annually by around 2026-2027 via a pipeline from Sakhalin Island in Russia\u2019s Far East.Russia\u2019s gas exports to China are still a small fraction of the record 177 bcm it delivered to Europe in 2018-19 annually.Russian gas now accounts for just 18% of European imports, down from 45% in 2021, while the bloc\u2019s oil imports from Russia have fallen to 3% from around 30% over that time. The European Union plans to fully phase out Russian energy by 2027.Russia and China are still in talks about a new Power of Siberia 2 pipeline capable of delivering 50 bcm of gas per year from Russia to China via Mongolia.Gazprom began a feasibility study for the pipeline in 2020, but the project has gained urgency as Russia turns to China to replace Europe as its major gas customer.Russia\u2019s liquefied natural gas exports to China rose last year by 3.3% to 8.3 million metric tons. Russia was, after Australia and Qatar, the third-largest supplier of LNG to China, which is the world\u2019s largest buyer of the sea-borne gas.OILChina has largely ignored the sanctions imposed by Western nations on seaborne Russian crude since late 2022.China, which is the world\u2019s top oil importer and a large Russian oil buyer, primarily buys East Siberia - Pacific Ocean (ESPO) crude exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino due to its proximity.China\u2019s crude oil imports from Russia were up 1% in 2024 to a record high versus 2023, while purchases from Saudi Arabia dropped 9%.Volumes from Russia - including pipeline and seaborne supplies - amounted last year to 108.5 million metric tons, according to China\u2019s General Administration of Customs, equivalent to 2.17 million barrels per day (bpd).China also receives Russian oil via the Skovorodino-Mohe pipeline spur of the 4,070-km (2,540-mile) ESPO pipeline, thereby bypassing any vessel and freight restrictions. It has a capacity of shipping 30 million metric tons annually.Russia has sought to raise its oil exports to China via Kazakhstan by 2.5 million tons per year.ProPicks AI evaluates GAZP alongside thousands of other companies every month using 100+ financial metrics.

Still, equities in China extended their recent bull run, fueled in part by a stronger-than-anticipated survey on manufacturing activity in the world\u2019s second largest economy.Hong Kong shares of e-commerce titan Alibaba (HK:9988) also notched a double-digit spike, its largest one-day surge since 2022, thanks to enthusiasm around the prospects for its cloud unit.Investors are gearing up for a return this week from a muted summer period. Awaiting them are a host of key upcoming events, including a slew of economic data points and a crucial Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- both of which could sway sentiment in September.Following a tariff-driven swoon in April, Wall Street has marched steadily higher, spurred on by hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping levies will not -- as many have feared -- plunge the U.S. economy into a recession. Optimism around the potential returns from massive investments in artificial intelligence has underpinned stocks as well.2. Legal battle over Trump\u2019s tariffsThe Trump administration\u2019s tariffs have faced a range of legal challenges, particularly from those who have argued against the president\u2019s use of emergency executive branch powers to put the import taxes in place.A crucial ruling was delivered late on Friday, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected the tariffs, upholding a lower court decision. The White House now has until mid-October to appeal to the Supreme Court, or else the ruling comes into effect.Media reports have suggested that Trump officials have long anticipated that the high court would eventually need to settle the matter, adding that the administration is confident that the tariffs -- and Trump\u2019s push to assert his authority to enact them -- will eventually be supported by the court\u2019s conservative majority.In a note to clients, analysts at Vital Knowledge said the the appeals court decision is \"at best neutral\" for markets, flagging it \"won\u2019t come close come close to eliminating Trump\u2019s import taxes, and it just creates more uncertainty for Corporate America as the White House searches for a studier legal scaffolding for its draconian trade policy[.]\"3. Economic data ahead this weekHeadlining the economic calendar this week will be release of the latest labor market report on Friday, which could provide some insight into the health of the wider economy and serve as one of the final tests of investor confidence that the Fed will slash rates at its September meeting.An unexpectedly soft U.S. payrolls report last month bolstered bets that the Fed would cut borrowing costs, even as policymakers remain wary of lingering inflationary pressures.Fed Chair Jerome Powell later suggested in a closely-monitored speech at an economic symposium in Wyoming that risks to the job market were increasing. As of Monday morning, there was a more than 87% probability that the Fed will reduce rates by 25 basis points from its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% at the end of its two-day gathering on Sept. 16-17, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool.Economists are estimating that nonfarm payrolls will come in at 74,000 in August, not far from the mark of 73,000 in July. The previous data set was itself a cause of controversy, with deep downward revisions sparking Trump\u2019s ire and leading to the ouster of the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the monthly jobs figures.4. China factory activity dataChina\u2019s factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in five months in August, a private-sector survey showed on Monday, offering a glimmer of improvement amid weaker official signals.The RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.5 in August from 49.5 in July, exceeding a forecast of 49.7 and breaking into expansion territory above the 50-point growth threshold.The jump was largely driven by a surge in new orders, the survey noted, even as export demand continued to decline for a fifth consecutive month. Meanwhile, firms reported their fastest accumulation of unfinished work in six months.\"New export orders are still in contraction, but the pace of decline has eased. That\u2019s encouraging, yet we shouldn\u2019t get carried away, because external demand looks partly pulled forward while domestic demand stays soft, so the upside to output may be limited unless domestic demand firms up,\" said Yao Yu, Founder at RatingDog.Despite the uptick, manufacturers remained cautious on hiring, with employment contracting for the fifth month running. Rising input costs, fueled by sharper raw material price increases, and persistent supplier delays also tempered optimism.5. Oil higherOil prices were higher in choppy trading on Monday, as traders weighed supply disruptions linked to airstrikes in the Russia-Ukraine conflict against the prospect of rising output and the impact of elevated U.S. tariffs on demand.By 03:41 ET, Brent Oil Futures expiring in October had risen 0.5% to $67.81 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures also ticked up 0.6% to $64.36 per barrel.Both contracts dropped more than 7% in August, dragged down by supply glut fears from steady OPEC+ production hikes.\u201cOil prices settled lower last week despite growing European calls for secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil and gas. The mild reaction may suggest the market is becoming increasingly numb towards sanction risks,\u201d analysts at ING said in a note.Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s president said on Sunday that the country would retaliate against Russian drone strikes on its power facilities. Both sides have exchanged air attacks in recent weeks that have targeted energy infrastructure and threatened to put a crimp on Russian oil exports.ProPicks AI evaluates 9988 alongside thousands of other companies every month using 100+ financial metrics.

Recent analyst reports paint a picture of a company leveraging its strengths in digital innovation and operational efficiency to counterbalance industry-wide challenges. According to InvestingPro analysis, SLB maintains a \"GREAT\" overall financial health score of 3.03 out of 5, suggesting strong fundamentals despite market headwinds.Schlumberger, commonly known as SLB, has established itself as a pivotal player in the oil and gas sector, offering a wide range of services and technologies crucial to energy exploration and production. The company\u2019s global footprint and diverse portfolio have positioned it as a bellwether for the industry, with its performance often seen as indicative of broader sector trends.Despite recent market volatility, SLB has maintained a significant presence in institutional portfolios. As of the second quarter of 2025, the company ranked sixth among long-only (LO) overweight positions, underscoring its continued appeal to major investors. This positioning comes despite a trend of selling from both LO and hedge fund (HF) investors observed in the first half of the year.The company\u2019s size and market presence have contributed to positive passive inflows, providing a degree of stability amidst active trading fluctuations. This dynamic highlights SLB\u2019s dual role as both a target for active management strategies and a core holding for index-tracking funds.SLB\u2019s management has articulated a clear vision for growth, centered on several key initiatives designed to differentiate the company from its peers and capitalize on emerging trends in the energy sector. The company\u2019s commitment to shareholder returns is evidenced by its impressive 55-year streak of maintaining dividend payments, with three consecutive years of dividend increases. InvestingPro subscribers can access additional insights about SLB\u2019s financial strength and growth potential through comprehensive analysis and expert research reports. At the forefront of this strategy are the company\u2019s investments in digital technologies, data centers, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) solutions.Analysts view these focus areas as unique growth drivers that could potentially insulate SLB from some of the regional spending trends affecting the broader industry. The emphasis on digital innovation, in particular, is seen as a critical factor that could drive outperformance in the latter half of 2025 and beyond.The company\u2019s digital strategy encompasses a range of technologies aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making processes in the energy sector. Operating with a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 0.67 and maintaining a healthy current ratio of 1.31, SLB appears well-positioned to fund its digital transformation initiatives while maintaining financial flexibility. According to InvestingPro, the stock generally trades with low price volatility, potentially offering investors a more stable exposure to the energy sector\u2019s digital evolution. By leveraging advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, SLB aims to offer its clients cutting-edge solutions that optimize production, reduce costs, and improve overall performance.Additionally, SLB\u2019s involvement in the growing field of carbon capture and storage aligns with the global push towards more sustainable energy practices. This positions the company to capitalize on increasing investments in technologies that mitigate the environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction and use.A key focus for investors and analysts alike is SLB\u2019s ambitious target of achieving a 25% EBITDA margin by 2025. This goal, reiterated by management in recent communications, has become a benchmark against which the company\u2019s performance is being measured. Currently trading at a P/E ratio of 12.5 and maintaining a gross profit margin of 20%, the company faces some challenges in reaching this target. InvestingPro data reveals 14 analysts have recently revised their earnings expectations downward for the upcoming period, suggesting careful monitoring of this target may be warranted.Analysts express cautious optimism about SLB\u2019s ability to reach this target, noting the company\u2019s confidence in portfolio outperformance driven by its digital and production segments. However, some firms have adjusted their forecasts in light of current market conditions. For instance, Barclays reduced its EBITDA estimates by 5% for 2025 and 8% for 2026, citing expectations of slowing revenue growth.Despite these revisions, the consensus among analysts seems to be that SLB\u2019s margin target remains achievable, particularly given the company\u2019s strategic focus on high-margin digital services and operational efficiencies. The potential realization of this goal could serve as a significant catalyst for the stock, especially considering recent underperformance relative to sector benchmarks like the Oil Services ETF (OIH).SLB\u2019s outlook is inextricably linked to broader industry dynamics, which present both challenges and opportunities. The energy sector is currently grappling with several significant uncertainties that could impact SLB\u2019s performance in the coming quarters.Chief among these concerns are the effects of tariffs and increased production from OPEC+ countries. These factors have introduced volatility into global energy markets and created uncertainty regarding upstream spending patterns for 2025. Analysts note that SLB\u2019s management has acknowledged these challenges but has not provided specific guidance on year-over-year spending trends for North America and international markets.The company\u2019s relatively lower upstream exposure compared to some of its peers is viewed as a potential buffer against these industry headwinds. This positioning could provide SLB with greater resilience in the face of sector volatility, though it does not entirely insulate the company from broader market trends.The decision by OPEC+ countries to increase production introduces significant uncertainty into the global oil market. Higher production levels could potentially lead to downward pressure on oil prices, which in turn might cause oil and gas companies to reduce their capital expenditures. As a service provider to these companies, SLB could face reduced demand for its offerings, particularly in areas related to exploration and new field development.Moreover, increased production from OPEC+ members might shift the focus of the industry towards maintaining and optimizing existing fields rather than exploring new ones. While SLB has a strong presence in production optimization services, a prolonged period of reduced exploration activity could negatively impact a significant portion of its business portfolio.The company\u2019s international exposure, which has historically been a strength, could become a double-edged sword in this scenario. While it provides diversification, it also increases SLB\u2019s sensitivity to global production trends and the strategic decisions of major oil-producing nations.SLB\u2019s ambitious target of reaching a 25% EBITDA margin by 2025 faces significant challenges in the current industry environment. The combination of potential pricing pressures due to increased competition and the need for continued investment in technology and innovation could strain the company\u2019s ability to expand margins.If upstream spending remains constrained due to market uncertainties, SLB may find it difficult to maintain pricing power for its services. This could lead to a scenario where the company must choose between maintaining market share at the expense of margins or preserving profitability at the risk of losing business to competitors.Additionally, the investments required to stay at the forefront of digital and technological advancements in the energy sector are substantial. While these investments are crucial for SLB\u2019s long-term competitiveness, they may create short-term pressure on margins, making the 25% EBITDA target more challenging to achieve within the stated timeframe.SLB\u2019s strategic focus on digital technologies positions the company at the forefront of a major industry shift towards data-driven operations. As oil and gas companies increasingly seek to optimize their operations and reduce costs, SLB\u2019s digital solutions could become increasingly indispensable.The company\u2019s investments in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced data analytics have the potential to create high-margin, recurring revenue streams. These digital offerings could provide SLB with a competitive edge, allowing it to capture a larger share of client budgets and potentially insulate itself from some of the cyclicality inherent in traditional oilfield services.Moreover, as the energy industry faces mounting pressure to improve efficiency and reduce its environmental footprint, SLB\u2019s digital solutions for optimizing production and minimizing waste could see growing demand. This trend could drive adoption of SLB\u2019s technologies across both new and existing client bases, potentially leading to market outperformance.The anticipated closing of the CHX deal, as mentioned in analyst reports, could serve as a significant catalyst for SLB\u2019s growth and market positioning. While specific details of the deal are not provided in the available information, strategic acquisitions in the energy sector often bring several benefits:1. Expanded service offerings: The CHX deal could potentially broaden SLB\u2019s portfolio of services or technologies, allowing it to capture a larger share of client spending and enter new market segments.2. Enhanced technological capabilities: If CHX brings complementary or advanced technologies to the table, this could accelerate SLB\u2019s innovation pipeline and strengthen its competitive position in key growth areas such as digital services or sustainable energy solutions.3. Geographical expansion: Depending on CHX\u2019s operational footprint, the deal could provide SLB with increased access to key markets or regions, diversifying its revenue streams and reducing dependence on any single geographical area.4. Synergies and cost efficiencies: Mergers and acquisitions often present opportunities for cost synergies through the consolidation of operations, shared resources, and economies of scale. These efficiencies could contribute to SLB\u2019s margin expansion goals.The successful integration of CHX could potentially position SLB as an even stronger player in the energy services market, driving both top-line growth and operational efficiencies that support its ambitious margin targets.Strengths:Weaknesses:Opportunities:Threats:This analysis is based on information available up to August 18, 2025, and reflects the market conditions and analyst perspectives as of that date.Gain an edge in your investment decisions with InvestingPro\u2019s in-depth analysis and exclusive insights on SLB.

OPEC Meetings schedule here.In the face of continued successful Ukrainian attacks on Russian facilities, we have an underappreciated war risk premium on supply. Yes, Russian output is stillborn with US/EU sanctions, however, should the political tensions warm up, this would instantly bring focus back to how much Russia can add back to global legitimate supplies.Meanwhile, Iran comes back into the picture.

A breakout could support a bullish oil outlook despite rising supply concerns.WTI OilLight crude oil futures moved higher on Monday in a quiet session, with U.S. markets closed for Labor Day. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is testing a resistance cluster defined by the 50-day moving average at $64.40 and the long-term 50% level at $64.56.At 10:28 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures are trading $64.65, up $0.64 or 1.00%.A breakout above this zone could unlock upside momentum toward last week\u2019s swing top at $65.10, followed by a minor pivot at $65.41. The next major objective is $66.18, which marks the 50% retracement of the $56.09 to $76.27 trading range. A sustained move through that level could drive prices toward heavier resistance between $68.70 and $69.69.On the downside, the 200-day moving average at $63.28 remains the key support level. With major players sidelined for the holiday, traders are treating price action with caution. Thin volume increases the likelihood of false breakouts and intraday traps.From a supply standpoint, the market remains heavy. U.S. crude production rose to a record 13.58 million barrels per day in June, according to the EIA, up 133,000 bpd. OPEC+ is set to increase output by 547,000 bpd in September, and analysts suggest the group may not be finished with supply hikes.Both WTI and Brent declined more than 6% in August, breaking a four-month winning streak as supply growth outpaced demand. A Reuters poll showed limited upside, with WTI expected to average $64.65 and Brent $67.65 in 2025. For now, rising production and soft demand projections continue to weigh on sentiment.Russia-Ukraine tensions remain a factor, offering a modest geopolitical risk premium. Russia\u2019s weekly crude exports fell to a four-week low of 2.72 million bpd, impacted by intensified cross-border strikes. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy vowed retaliation following fresh attacks on power facilities.While no major supply outages have materialized, risks remain elevated. Markets are also monitoring a regional summit in Beijing involving Russia, India, and China ahead of the September 7 OPEC+ meeting.WTI\u2019s near-term setup looks technically bullish, but conviction is lacking without participation from large funds.

The broader tone remains hesitant, with traders waiting for firmer signals from both fundamentals and the technical picture.OPEC+ continues to quietly increase production, clawing back barrels without rattling prices too much. While the group hasn\u2019t made aggressive moves, supply has been drifting higher over recent weeks, weighing slightly on sentiment. Traders are also squaring up ahead of the September 7 meeting, though early signals suggest no major quota changes. With seasonal demand waning, this steady return of OPEC+ supply is starting to tip the balance.Russian crude exports picked back up after brief disruptions. The Druzhba pipeline, which supplies Hungary and Slovakia, resumed service following a Ukrainian drone strike. At the same time, Moscow boosted its August exports from western ports by 200,000 barrels per day, a move that softened some of the geopolitical premium built into the market. Even so, Russian infrastructure remains in the crosshairs, and traders haven\u2019t dismissed the risk of fresh outages.The latest U.S. inventory data\u00a0showed a 2.4 million barrel draw, stronger than the expected 1.9 million. That helped briefly lift prices midweek. But with the summer driving season wrapping up, gasoline demand is underwhelming and traders aren\u2019t treating the draw as the start of a sustained trend. Freight and industrial demand still look steady, but not strong enough to push the tape on their own.The 52-week moving average at $63.35 is the most important line in the sand. Crude has now held above it for two straight weeks, and as long as that holds, the tone stays neutral-to-constructive.

Technically, the path of least resistance remains lower unless bulls can clear $66.18 with conviction and a supporting catalyst.Traders are now focused on next week\u2019s OPEC+ meeting, with expectations building that the group will continue ramping up production. Increased crude supply from the alliance is weighing heavily on oil prices, especially as demand in the U.S. appears to be cooling with the summer driving season coming to a close after Labor Day. Andrew Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates summed up the mood: \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a jump in supply feeding into a lackluster demand market.\u201dDespite the bearish tilt, some analysts point to tighter-than-expected U.S. crude inventories. Weekly data for the period ending August 22 showed stronger draws, particularly in industrial and freight sectors. This suggests that near-term demand may still have legs, offering a counterbalance to the bearish sentiment around global supply.Earlier gains this week came from geopolitical tensions\u2014specifically, Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil infrastructure. But with reports of a possible ceasefire being discussed among Ukraine\u2019s European allies, bullish momentum faded quickly. Meanwhile, India continues to defy U.S. pressure to halt Russian oil imports, with volumes expected to rise further in September, reinforcing the theme of robust non-Western demand.With crude futures breaking below key technical supports and a supply increase from OPEC+ on the horizon, the oil market is tilting bearish. Unless the $66.18 resistance is breached with strong buying interest and a new catalyst, rallies are likely to be short-lived. A break below $61.12 could trigger a deeper sell-off. For now, traders should expect a market under pressure.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Ultimately, we have to get through a lot of supply at the moment in order to see massive moves higher.WTI OilBrent OilThe light sweet crude oil market is struggling with the $65 level again this week, as we continue to see a lot of noisy external pressures in this market. When you look at this market, the $65 level has been important multiple times going back a couple of years and therefore, it\u2019s not a huge surprise to see that it is difficult to get above it.The market is looking to close slightly positive, but really at this point, I think we are trying to sort out whether or not we have a trading range so I don\u2019t know what that range is yet, but I think we\u2019re probably looking at something along the lines of the $62 level on the bottom to the $70 level on the top, if it plays out a little bit more positively. The $65 level is a magnet for price, so keep that in mind. I think we may even tighten up further.Brent markets also look very much the same. I think we have a situation that is going to be looking for some levels to make a decision on where the top and bottom of the range are. The bottom right now, I suppose the candidate is $65, the top is probably 73. Keep in mind that oil markets might be a little sluggish anyway, due to the fact that economic activity seems to be slowing down. And of course, OPEC, Russia and the United States are all flooding the market with plenty of supply.So, with that being the case, pricing power is a little bit wanting in all grades of crude oil. We are probably not going to fall to a fresh new low, but I don\u2019t know if\u00a0 we\u2019re going to have a massively bullish move either.

All things being equal, I think we are trying to jump back above the $65 level in order to find some type of range, perhaps between $62 and $70. But we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens next. I believe at this point oil is going to continue to struggle for a whole host of external reasons.So, with that being said, you have to keep in mind that supply is overwhelming demand. And if we get an economic disruption via recession, that doesn\u2019t help either. Russia, OPEC, and the United States are all pumping oil out, and that will keep this market somewhat sluggish. What I\u2019m hoping to see is a defined range that we can trade back and forth.Brent markets look very much the same. It looks like they\u2019re using $67 as support. So, we\u2019ll see if that holds. We are right about at the 50 day EMA, but if we can break above the $69 level, it does open up a move to the 200 day EMA. A breakdown below $65 opens up a drop to the $62.50 level. And again, this is a market that I think is held hostage to the oversupply coming out of Russia, OPEC, and the US.

Add in the fact that Russia\u2019s crude is still flowing\u2014especially to India, which is brushing off U.S. pressure to cut ties\u2014and that\u2019s helping to cap upside momentum for now.Earlier in the week, crude caught a bounce after Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil export infrastructure, plus a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories.

The day\u2019s high reached $65.15, while a higher low at $63.95 reinforced buyer control. This advance may have completed a brief two-day pullback from Monday\u2019s swing high of $65.77, which itself followed a consolidation breakout last Thursday. The short length of the pullback signals strong underlying demand, with buyers stepping in quickly to support prices.Yesterday\u2019s decline completed a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent upswing, helping stabilize demand and setting up today\u2019s breakout. A second daily close above the 20-Day moving average now looks likely, which would mark the second such close in four days\u2014a constructive sign for the bulls. Sustained trade above this level strengthens the case for further upside attempts.Immediate resistance lies at this week\u2019s $65.77 high, reinforced by an anchored volume weighted average price (AVWAP) around $65.49. Beyond that, the next significant test appears near the 50-Day moving average, currently at $66.43 and declining. It has converged with a falling downtrend line. This convergence raises the significance of the area as a potential reversal point. Should momentum carry further, the 200-Day moving average near $67.85 offers the next logical upside target.Despite recent strength, the current move still forms part of a counter-trend rally within a broader downtrend. Historically, such rallies often stall when encountering major moving averages or prior support levels that have turned into resistance. As such, traders should be alert for selling pressure near the 50-Day or 200-Day averages, where the risk of reversal remains elevated.On a broader timeframe, crude oil triggered a weekly inside week bullish reversal after reclaiming the 20-Week moving average for the first time in four weeks.

The consortium plans to drill one exploration well before the end of 2025.TotalEnergies will operate the permit with a 50% stake, while QatarEnergy holds 35%, and SNPC holds the remaining 15%. The Nzombo permit covers 1,000 square kilometers and is located approximately 100 kilometers off the coast of Pointe-Noire. Its proximity to the existing Moho production facilities, which TotalEnergies EP Congo also operates, is a key strategic advantage.The award of this permit underscores the continued investment in Congo\u2019s oil and gas sector, which is a major contributor to the country's economy. The Republic of the Congo is the sixth-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa. The government has expressed an ambition to increase its oil output to 500,000 barrels per day by 2027 and is actively seeking foreign investment to modernize its hydrocarbon sector. The Nzombo permit award aligns with this national strategy and signals a continued partnership between major international energy companies and the Congolese state.The permit is a \"high impact prospect\" that can be developed using existing infrastructure, according to Kevin McLachlan, senior vice president of exploration at TotalEnergies. The drilling program aims to assess the potential of the Nzombo prospect, which, if successful, could contribute to TotalEnergies' global production portfolio and the Republic of the Congo's goal of increasing its output.This project is the latest collaboration between TotalEnergies and QatarEnergy, which have a history of partnering on large-scale energy projects globally, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Qatar. Their joint participation in the Nzombo permit highlights a shared strategy of expanding exploration activities and leveraging existing partnerships to develop new resources.

India has eased back slightly on purchases of Urals barrels, trimming perhaps three to five hundred thousand barrels per day, but the overall message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has been firm. Cheap Russian oil remains too valuable to give up, and the political mood at home rewards defiance rather than retreat.For the United States, the dilemma is clear. A threatened rise in tariffs on Indian exports to America would not just squeeze New Delhi. It would also feed directly into US inflation at a time when domestic prices are already a sensitive political issue. Indian refiners are still importing more than one and a half million barrels per day of Russian crude. If those volumes were forced out of the market overnight, replacement barrels would come at a higher cost, pushing up fuel prices worldwide. Punishment for India could quickly turn into pain for American consumers.Events in Ukraine have only sharpened the tension. Attacks on Russian refineries and ports continue, disrupting product flows and forcing Moscow to ship more crude abroad. The market is already unsettled, and any sudden shift in Indian buying habits risks aggravating the volatility. Washington knows this. The memory of 2022, when emergency stock releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve were needed to cool oil prices, still hangs heavy.Related: India Dismisses U.S. Criticism of Profiteering from Russian Oil ImportsChina complicates the picture. As India trims a fraction of its purchases, Chinese buyers appear to have stepped in, though their capacity to absorb further volumes remains a key question mark. Beijing has the advantage of shadow financial channels that allow it to skirt sanctions more easily. India lacks such networks, leaving its refiners more exposed to pressure. The precedent is important: during the previous Trump administration, India halted Iranian imports entirely once secondary sanctions were imposed. That history gives the United States a measure of confidence that firm action could eventually force Modi\u2019s hand.Critics argue that India has profited handsomely from discounted Russian oil.

Under normal circumstances, oil and gas producers tend to cut back output whenever prices fall too much in a bid to cut their losses. For instance, several U.S. shale producers are signaling production cuts due to low oil prices: back in May, Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) chair and CEO Travis Stice warned that the Shale Patch had reached a \"tipping point\" with production set to decrease going forward amid low oil prices.To understand the situation in China, you have to not only look at the country\u2019s unique position as a major oil producer and importer but also at the outsized role that the government plays in the oil and gas sector (national oil companies produce 85% of China\u2019s oil).\u00a0 China commenced oil production in the 1960s and managed to achieve energy self-sufficiency by the mid-1990s, producing more oil than it consumed. This allowed the country to reduce its need for oil imports for a period.However, this changed three decades ago, with China becoming a net importer of oil since 1994 as consumption overtook domestic production thanks to a booming economy. However, consumption has risen much more rapidly than production, and the gap keeps widening: Last year, China produced nearly 5 million barrels of crude per day (mb/d), but consumed more than 16 mb/d. To date, China remains the world's largest importer of crude oil, relying heavily on imports to meet its high consumption levels.China\u2019s oil production increased steadily over the next two decades until it declined sharply in 2016, thanks to the international oil price crash. Domestic production started recovering in 2019, and continued growing through the pandemic despite global oil prices sinking to historic lows. The decoupling between production and oil prices in recent years has mainly been driven by pressure from the Chinese government to boost domestic exploration and production under its \u201cSeven-Year Action Plans to Enhance Oil and Gas Exploration\u201d of 2019-2025. Beijing is focused on boosting its energy security through increased domestic production and building up strategic oil reserves to mitigate potential disruptions from international supply channels.Source: Oxford Institute For Energy StudiesOver the previous decade, Beijing was predominantly focused on shale gas production. However,\u00a0 in 2019, rising trade tensions with the U.S. prompted China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to call for a ramp-up in exploration and production of both oil and gas. In the same year, the government held a meeting with China\u2019s leading national oil companies (NOCs), wherein it launched the 7-Year Plan. In 2020, Beijing introduced several amendments to the Resource Tax Law, cutting the resource tax rates by as much as 40% for heavy oil. The government also waived import duties and VAT for a range of imported oilfield equipment where such equipment was not locally available or did not meet the required performance standards.", "analysis": 1}, "65": {"type": "news", "title": "Russian Oil Giants Buckle Under Low Prices and Sanctions", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-oil-giants-buckle-under-230000596.html", "date": "2025-09-01T23:00:00.000Z", "body": "Russia\u2019s oil giants are being squeezed from all sides\u2014by falling crude prices, sanctions, and punishing interest rates\u2014leaving first-half profits in freefall and exposing the limits of Moscow\u2019s ability to shield its energy sector from global headwinds.Rosneft, the country\u2019s largest oil producer, reported a 68% decline in profits for the first six months of 2025 versus the same period of 2024, citing a global crude oil oversupply driven by OPEC+\u2019s unwinding of production cuts. Chief executive Igor Sechin warned that the surplus could reach 2.6 million bpd in Q4 2025, prolonging price weakness into 2026. Sechin also criticized Russian monetary policy, arguing that the elevated key interest rate artificially strengthens the ruble, hurting exporters and eroding state revenues.\u201cThe first half of this year was characterized by lower oil prices, primarily due to the overproduction of oil,\u201d Sechin said in the company\u2019s statement. \u201cIn addition, there was an expansion of discounts on Russian oil due to the tightening of EU and US sanctions restrictions and a significant strengthening of the ruble exchange rate, which negatively affected the financial results of all exporters.\u201dEven without sanctions, Western Big Oil also suffered lower financial results this year as prices remained stubbornly low despite repeated risks to supply related mostly to geopolitics. Forecasts, however, continue to see an overhang in supply with demand growth slowing down, which is affecting international prices and therefore company earnings results. OPEC is one of the few that do not foresee a glut in oil, which, one might argue, is only to be expected from an oil producers\u2019 club and not to be taken too seriously.Bloomberg reported last week that Russia\u2019s number-two in oil, Lukoil, had also reported a sizable decline in first-half profits, at 51%, reportedly. However, there was no information about Lukoil\u2019s January-June financial results on the company\u2019s website.Gazprom Neft, meanwhile, booked a profit drop of 54% for the first six months of the year, attributing it to higher taxes and, interestingly, a weaker, rather than stronger, ruble. Per the company, which is the oil-focused arm of state gas major Gazprom, the combination of headwinds had affected the profitability of its operations across both upstream and downstream businesses.Novatek, the largest private gas producer in Russia, also suffered a dip in its profit for the first half of the year, but that was attributable more to its higher operating expenses, per its financial report, rather than any other factor, suggesting gas producers, and more specifically LNG producers, are somewhat insulated from the worst effects of Western sanctions.

Puri made the remarks in a column in The Hindu newspaper.Indian refiners have continued to take Russian oil, despite a brief pause in early August, and cheaper Urals are likely to attract strong buying interest.

Futures slipU.S. stock futures dropped on Tuesday, as traders returned for a week shortened by a holiday but not devoid of potentially consequential events.By 03:37 ET (07:37 GMT), the Dow futures contract had fallen by 113 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures had shed 15 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had declined by 65 points, or 0.3%.The main averages on Wall Street were closed on Monday in observance of the Labor Day holiday. At the end of the last trading day on Friday, stocks dipped, weighed down partially by declines in artificial intelligence-related names.But, despite August being a traditionally difficult for stocks, the S&P 500 gained 1.9% for the month, bringing its year-to-date advance to roughly 10% and putting the benchmark index not far from record highs. It was the latest leg higher in what has become an extended recovery in equities since an April swoon sparked by concerns over sweeping U.S. tariffs.2. ISM manufacturing PMI aheadInvestors are now turning their gazes back to the economic calendar, which will be headlined this week by Friday\u2019s release of the ever-important monthly nonfarm payrolls report.Analysts have said that a soft or tepid reading for August -- which would come after an unexpectedly weak return in July and deep downward revisions to the preceding two months -- could further cement bets that the Federal Reserve will ratchet down interest rates at its next policy meeting on Sept. 16-17.Economists expect the U.S. to have added 74,000 roles, versus in 73,000 in July.In the meantime, markets will be keeping tabs on other indicators, including a gauge of U.S. manufacturing sector activity on Tuesday from the Institute for Supply Management.

Long-time Chair Paul Bulcke has also said he will step down in 2026.4. Gold hits record highGold prices touched a new record high on Tuesday, as bullion\u2019s longstanding safe-haven appeal was burnished by wagers of U.S. interest rate cuts and murkiness around U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs.Broader metal prices also notched strong gains, with silver surging to a near 14-year high, while platinum remained in sight of a 11-year high. This came as the dollar sank to a five-week low on expectations of falling U.S. borrowing costs.Non-yielding assets such as metals tend to benefit from lower rates, given that they make commodities appear more attractive over investing in government debt.Spot gold surged 0.8% to a record high of $3,508.54 an ounce, while Gold Futures for December hit a peak of $3,578.20/oz. Spot prices curbed some gains to trade 0.2% higher at $3,482.28/oz by 03:27 ET.Gold\u2019s latest round of gains was spurred by heightened uncertainty over Trump\u2019s trade tariffs, after an appeals court ruled last week that they were illegal. While the court said Trump\u2019s tariffs could remain in place until mid-October, the president criticized the decision and said he would challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court.5.

The U.S. and its allies are also stepping up enforcement of secondary sanctions on Russian oil, though the measures have so far had limited impact on flows to Asia.Partly offsetting these risks was increased production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) in recent months, which has raised worries over a possible supply glut.

Rising long-term government bond yields in Britain, France and the United States may reflect debt concerns as we enter the annual budget season and higher oil prices aren\u2019t helping things, but the simultaneous rise of gold and the dollar made less sense.The rise in volatility has knocked back stocks worldwide.* Europe was the epicentre of Tuesday's bond jolt, with France's 30-year government bond yields hitting their highest in over 16 years as Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou began talks with political parties in a bid to prevent a government collapse over his budget. Britain's 30-year borrowing costs rose to their highest levels since 1998 and sterling slid more than 1% on Tuesday, with this week's reshuffle of PM Keir Starmer's economic team ahead of the Autumn budget raising questions about the position of Chancellor Rachel Reeves. With Fed independence a key focus in a big week for labor data on Wall Street, U.S. 30-year yields stalked 5% yet again and hit their highest in over a month - sending the 2-to-30-year yield curve to its highest in almost four years.* With China's gathering of its Russian, North Korean and Indian allies this week as a backdrop, gold soared to record highs on a heady mix of long-term inflation and government debt concerns - bursting through April's prior peak to top $3,500 per ounce and clocking year-to-date gains of 33%. However, the dollar - unusually in times of stress this year - also surged against the euro, sterling, yen and yuan - with U.S. payrolls eyed, real-time U.S. GDP estimates running at 3.5% for the third quarter and August manufacturing surveys due later.* Elsewhere, global stocks were down generally - with Wall Street futures down about 0.5% after a rough session last Friday saw a 1%-plus shakeout in the tech sector. There was also a wave of uncertainty over fresh legal challenges to President Trump's 'reciprocal' tariffs - a ruling that arrived after Friday's closing bell. The tech wobble hit Japanese and South Korean stocks on Monday, but they recovered some of that today.

President Zelenskyy\u2019s vow for \u201cdeep strikes\u201d suggests the threat to infrastructure is ongoing.Meanwhile, diplomatic tensions are adding further pressure.

While the group recently accelerated the rollback of a 2.2 million bpd cut, analysts at ING expect no major policy shift in October. The prevailing view is that supply will remain tight, and the larger risk lies in potential reinstatement of deeper cuts if the market softens.SEB Commodities, however, warned in a client note that prices could average as low as $55 in Q4 unless OPEC+ intervenes again. Such bearish estimates are currently being counterbalanced by physical disruptions and geopolitical tensions.On the demand side, attention is turning to U.S. labor data due later this week, which could influence the Fed\u2019s next rate decision. A weaker jobs report would bolster expectations for monetary easing at the September 16\u201317 meeting. A rate cut would likely pressure the dollar and support demand for dollar-denominated commodities like crude.With technical breakouts aligning with tightening physical supply and potential Fed easing, the near-term outlook for oil remains bullish. If WTI clears $66.18, traders should prepare for a fast move toward $68.70, with supply risks and macro policy shifts offering a supportive backdrop. However, any failure to hold above the 50-day average could reverse momentum sharply.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Imports rebounded in August as prices in May-early June \u2013 when the cargoes were likely arranged \u2013 were at the lower end of this year\u2019s range in the low $60s per barrel of Brent Crude oil.The biggest Asian importers, China and India, took advantage of the weak oil prices to boost purchases for August-arriving cargoes. China, the world\u2019s top crude oil importer, and India, the third largest in the world, can sway the trend in Asian imports with their purchases.It is not certain if rising demand in the summer or weak oil prices in May were the primary drivers.In August, China and India imported more crude from both Saudi Arabia and Russia, per LSEG Oil Research data.The two major importers remain opportunistic buyers, nominating more crude when prices are low.Earlier this year, Asia\u2019s crude oil imports surged in June to the highest level in two and a half years, but the rise isn\u2019t necessarily attributable to strengthening oil demand after a soft start to the year.Cargoes arriving in Asia in June were likely contracted six to eight weeks prior\u2014in April, when\u00a0oil prices crashed\u00a0amid the OPEC+ production hikes plan and the U.S. tariff blitz.Going forward, Asia\u2019s imports in September could be lower as oil prices briefly surged in the second half of June to above $80 per barrel during the Israel-Iran war.By Michael Kern for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.comSanctioned Russian Arctic LNG 2 Project Is Shipping CargoesSyria Exports First Crude Oil in 14 YearsRussia and China Ink Deal for Massive New Gas PipelineRead this article on OilPrice.com", "analysis": 1}, "90": {"type": "news", "title": "See Big Upside for Oil? 3 Great Ways to Play an Oil Price Rebound.", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/see-big-upside-oil-3-133400788.html", "date": "2025-09-02T13:34:00.000Z", "body": "If you want to play an oil rebound the \"safe\" way, stick to a diversified industry leader like Chevron.Diamondback Energy's cash returns rise with its oil-fueled free cash flow.ExxonMobil's growth plans almost assure bigger dividends for investors.10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobil \u203aOil prices have slumped this year. WTI, the primary U.S. oil price benchmark, is down over 10%. It has fallen from its peak in the low-$80s to the mid-$60s. That's cutting into the cash flows produced by oil and gas companies.While oil prices are currently down, any number of catalysts could fuel a rally in the price of crude. If you're bullish on crude prices, Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) are great ways to play a potential rebound in oil. Here's why a few Fool.com contributing analysts think they're among the best oil stocks to buy to cash in on a potential rebound in oil prices.Reuben Gregg Brewer (Chevron): The truth is that integrated energy giant Chevron is kind of a boring way to invest in oil and natural gas. For example, Chevron doesn't use much leverage, with its debt-to-equity ratio at a very low 0.20x or so. And it has long focused on paying a reliable dividend, with dividend hikes in each of the past 38 years. Add in an attractive 4.3% dividend yield and a diversified business, and it is a relatively \"safe\" way to invest in the energy sector.That said, a strong balance sheet and a reliable high yield could allow even conservative investors to add energy exposure to their portfolios. The energy sector is known for volatility, with oil prices often rising and falling in dramatic, and swift, fashion. Less aggressive investors, by nature, would probably want to avoid the sector, even though energy is an important part of the global economy.But Chevron changes up the math. Sure, a conservative income investor might want to avoid a pure-play driller like Devon Energy, which has had a highly volatile dividend history. But Chevron has proven it can be counted on to keep paying in both good oil markets and bad ones.So even if you worry about the downside risk in the oil sector, you should still feel confident in adding Chevron to your portfolio. Thus, if you have a constructive view of oil prices today, there's no reason to not invest in the energy sector just because you are a conservative income investor.Matt DiLallo (Diamondback Energy): Diamondback Energy controls a premier oil resource. The company's large-scale position in the Permian Basin spans 859,000 net acres across West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. Its massive scale in this low-cost region enables it to generate industry-leading cash flow margins. As a result, it can produce significant excess free cash flow at lower oil prices (more than $4.9 billion after capital spending at $50 oil).", "analysis": 1}, "91": {"type": "news", "title": "Oil rises 1% ahead of OPEC+ meeting", "source": "investing", "link": "https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-rises-as-russiaukraine-tensions-stoke-supply-concerns-4218329", "date": "2025-09-02T15:48:24+00:00", "body": "By Georgina McCartneyHOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil prices rose on Tuesday ahead of an upcoming OPEC+ meeting on Sunday, in which analysts expect the group will not unwind remaining voluntary cuts.Brent crude was up 72 cents, or 1.06%, at $68.87 a barrel by 11:07 a.m. EDT (1507 GMT).U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $65.34 a barrel, $1.33 or 2.08% higher.

There is some concern about availability in the non-sanctioned pool of oil which may be becoming more dear supply wise, as there is going to be less opportunity to buy these grey market barrels if sanctions ratchet up,\" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital.Investors also considered the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit 2025, which took place from August 31 to September 1 and was attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who pressed their vision for a new global security and economic order that prioritises the \"Global South\", in a direct challenge to the United States.The two-day event was attended by more than 20 leaders of non-Western countries, including India\u2019s Narendra Modi, who is visiting China for the first time in seven years.This conference may force U.S. President Donald Trump to react and could spur more secondary sanctions, especially on India, lending some support to oil prices according to Kilduff.\"This was an important conference that was not on everyone\u2019s radar as it should have been,\" Kilduff said.Elsewhere, India is in talks with the U.S. for a bilateral trade agreement, India\u2019s trade minister Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday, days after Washington doubled tariffs on goods from India as a punitive measure for New Delhi\u2019s continued importation of Russian oil.\u00a0Expectations that U.S. data will show another crude draw were also boosting the market, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.The U.S. summer driving season officially ended with Monday\u2019s Labor Day holiday, ending the highest demand period in the world\u2019s largest fuel market.On the supply side, Ukrainian drone attacks have shut down facilities accounting for at least 17% of Russia\u2019s oil-processing capacity, or 1.1 million barrels per day, according to Reuters\u2019 calculations.Meanwhile, Kazakhstan\u2019s daily crude oil output, excluding gas condensate, a type of light oil, rose to 1.88 million barrels per day in August from 1.84 million bpd in July, a source familiar with the data told Reuters on Tuesday.Kazakh crude oil output last month rose 2% from July on a daily basis, according to Reuters calculations.Get an up-to-the-minute summary from WarrenAI, our powerful AI financial researcher.

There is some concern about availability in the non-sanctioned pool of oil which may be becoming more dear supply-wise, as there is going to be less opportunity to buy these grey market barrels if sanctions ratchet up,\" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital.Investors also considered the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit 2025, which took place from August 31 to September 1.

What I find interesting is that we have found the 50 day EMA again, which sits right at $65 level. The $65 level, of course, is an area where we have seen both support and resistance, so I\u2019ll be watching that very closely for a potential turnaround. If we can break above the $65 level rather handily, then we could go looking at the $67 level. A pullback from here just means that we continue with the same consolidation pattern that we\u2019ve been in for the last five or six trading sessions, which is very possible at this point.Brent markets have rallied as well, but we are sitting here at the 50 day EMA also, with the $67 level underneath offering support and the $66 level underneath there also offering support. To the upside, the $70 level is a potential target as it is a large round, psychologically significant figure and an area that sits just below the crucial 200 day EMA. With that being said, the market is very noisy, but I think more than anything else, the market is sideways. And I think that\u2019s how you have to look at it.

In order for the squeeze to have maximum effect, WTI MUST be held by buyers at Q-1 $63.63. A small excursion below is acceptable-say to $64.00, last weeks average price.

The next major objective is $66.18, which marks the 50% retracement of the $56.09 to $76.27 trading range. A sustained move through that level could drive prices toward heavier resistance between $68.70 and $69.69.On the downside, the 200-day moving average at $63.28 remains the key support level. With major players sidelined for the holiday, traders are treating price action with caution. Thin volume increases the likelihood of false breakouts and intraday traps.From a supply standpoint, the market remains heavy. U.S. crude production rose to a record 13.58 million barrels per day in June, according to the EIA, up 133,000 bpd. OPEC+ is set to increase output by 547,000 bpd in September, and analysts suggest the group may not be finished with supply hikes.Both WTI and Brent declined more than 6% in August, breaking a four-month winning streak as supply growth outpaced demand. A Reuters poll showed limited upside, with WTI expected to average $64.65 and Brent $67.65 in 2025. For now, rising production and soft demand projections continue to weigh on sentiment.Russia-Ukraine tensions remain a factor, offering a modest geopolitical risk premium. Russia\u2019s weekly crude exports fell to a four-week low of 2.72 million bpd, impacted by intensified cross-border strikes. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy vowed retaliation following fresh attacks on power facilities.While no major supply outages have materialized, risks remain elevated. Markets are also monitoring a regional summit in Beijing involving Russia, India, and China ahead of the September 7 OPEC+ meeting.WTI\u2019s near-term setup looks technically bullish, but conviction is lacking without participation from large funds. A break above $66.18 on stronger volume could pave the way to upper resistance zones. Until then, rising output from the U.S. and OPEC+ continues to limit upside. The oil prices forecast remains neutral to bearish unless price clears key levels with confirmation post-holiday.More Information in our Light Crude Oil Futures.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

OPEC+ output hikes have lifted the global supply outlook, while the fading U.S. driving season is adding pressure to consumption.Yet, geopolitical tensions continue to inject a risk premium into energy markets, balancing oversupply fears with uncertainty over potential disruptions to global flows. Natural gas followed similar volatility, with traders weighing production trends against the broader backdrop of geopolitical instability.As OPEC+ prepares to meet and markets monitor international developments, crude and gas prices remain vulnerable to both supply shifts and geopolitical shocks.Natural gas futures are trading around $3.04 after breaking out of a falling channel that capped prices through August.

The broader tone remains hesitant, with traders waiting for firmer signals from both fundamentals and the technical picture.OPEC+ continues to quietly increase production, clawing back barrels without rattling prices too much. While the group hasn\u2019t made aggressive moves, supply has been drifting higher over recent weeks, weighing slightly on sentiment. Traders are also squaring up ahead of the September 7 meeting, though early signals suggest no major quota changes. With seasonal demand waning, this steady return of OPEC+ supply is starting to tip the balance.Russian crude exports picked back up after brief disruptions. The Druzhba pipeline, which supplies Hungary and Slovakia, resumed service following a Ukrainian drone strike. At the same time, Moscow boosted its August exports from western ports by 200,000 barrels per day, a move that softened some of the geopolitical premium built into the market. Even so, Russian infrastructure remains in the crosshairs, and traders haven\u2019t dismissed the risk of fresh outages.The latest U.S. inventory data\u00a0showed a 2.4 million barrel draw, stronger than the expected 1.9 million.

Freight and industrial demand still look steady, but not strong enough to push the tape on their own.The 52-week moving average at $63.35 is the most important line in the sand. Crude has now held above it for two straight weeks, and as long as that holds, the tone stays neutral-to-constructive.

This weekly decline marked the end of a tough month, with oil shedding 6.47% in August. Key resistance levels now stand at $65.10, $65.41, and $66.18\u2014the latter being a technical trigger that could spark a bullish breakout toward $69.69. Until then, any upside move is likely to remain capped.On the downside, the 200-day moving average at $63.26 is the critical support level. A break below that would likely open the door to $61.12\u2014the August 13 low\u2014and potentially to $56.09 if bearish momentum accelerates. Technically, the path of least resistance remains lower unless bulls can clear $66.18 with conviction and a supporting catalyst.Traders are now focused on next week\u2019s OPEC+ meeting, with expectations building that the group will continue ramping up production. Increased crude supply from the alliance is weighing heavily on oil prices, especially as demand in the U.S. appears to be cooling with the summer driving season coming to a close after Labor Day. Andrew Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates summed up the mood: \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a jump in supply feeding into a lackluster demand market.\u201dDespite the bearish tilt, some analysts point to tighter-than-expected U.S. crude inventories. Weekly data for the period ending August 22 showed stronger draws, particularly in industrial and freight sectors. This suggests that near-term demand may still have legs, offering a counterbalance to the bearish sentiment around global supply.Earlier gains this week came from geopolitical tensions\u2014specifically, Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil infrastructure. But with reports of a possible ceasefire being discussed among Ukraine\u2019s European allies, bullish momentum faded quickly. Meanwhile, India continues to defy U.S. pressure to halt Russian oil imports, with volumes expected to rise further in September, reinforcing the theme of robust non-Western demand.With crude futures breaking below key technical supports and a supply increase from OPEC+ on the horizon, the oil market is tilting bearish. Unless the $66.18 resistance is breached with strong buying interest and a new catalyst, rallies are likely to be short-lived. A break below $61.12 could trigger a deeper sell-off. For now, traders should expect a market under pressure.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

The $65 level is a magnet for price, so keep that in mind. I think we may even tighten up further.Brent markets also look very much the same. I think we have a situation that is going to be looking for some levels to make a decision on where the top and bottom of the range are. The bottom right now, I suppose the candidate is $65, the top is probably 73. Keep in mind that oil markets might be a little sluggish anyway, due to the fact that economic activity seems to be slowing down. And of course, OPEC, Russia and the United States are all flooding the market with plenty of supply.So, with that being the case, pricing power is a little bit wanting in all grades of crude oil. We are probably not going to fall to a fresh new low, but I don\u2019t know if\u00a0 we\u2019re going to have a massively bullish move either.

So, we\u2019ll see if that holds. We are right about at the 50 day EMA, but if we can break above the $69 level, it does open up a move to the 200 day EMA. A breakdown below $65 opens up a drop to the $62.50 level. And again, this is a market that I think is held hostage to the oversupply coming out of Russia, OPEC, and the US. With that being said, I expect sideways action more than anything else, but I also think we\u2019re still in the middle of trying to define where that action is.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.Chris is a proprietary trader with more than 20 years of experience across various markets, including currencies, indices and commodities.

The 50-day moving average at $64.60 is still acting like a firm ceiling, while the 200-day at $63.26 has been holding up as a solid floor. We\u2019re seeing a bit of chop here as traders test both sides, with not a whole lot of conviction either way.At 11:23 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures are trading $64.35, down $0.25 or -0.39%.Fundamentally, we\u2019ve got some push and pull. Prices took a hit Friday on worries about slowing demand, especially with the U.S. summer driving season winding down after Labor Day. But even with that, WTI\u2019s up about 1% on the week\u2014so there\u2019s been some dip-buying under the hood.Traders are also squaring up ahead of next week\u2019s OPEC+ meeting. The group\u2019s been quietly increasing output to claw back market share, which has started to weigh on the overall supply outlook. Add in the fact that Russia\u2019s crude is still flowing\u2014especially to India, which is brushing off U.S. pressure to cut ties\u2014and that\u2019s helping to cap upside momentum for now.Earlier in the week, crude caught a bounce after Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil export infrastructure, plus a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories. That drawdown suggested some lingering strength in industrial and freight-related demand, even as the broader consumer fuel demand starts to cool.But again, sellers are testing the nerves of buyers here. Bulls have had a hard time getting through that $64.56\u2013$65.41 zone, and we\u2019re seeing profit-taking near those levels. There\u2019s also a trigger line up at $66.18\u2014break above that, and it doesn\u2019t take a lot of imagination to see a run toward $69.69. That being said, such a move would need a real catalyst\u2014maybe geopolitical, maybe a surprise from OPEC+.So for now, the market looks content to continue to consolidate between $63.26 and $64.60. A clean break below $63.26 likely opens the door for a test of $61.12. On the upside, buyers need to chew through $64.56, $65.41, and $66.18 before any real breakout talk gets serious.More likely than not, we stay rangebound heading into the long weekend, with traders eyeing next week\u2019s OPEC+ decision and any surprise geopolitical headlines. Until then, we\u2019re just working off some of the excess from earlier this week.Unless bulls take out $66.18 with conviction, the path of least resistance looks sideways to lower. Time will tell, but right now the burden\u2019s on the bulls.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

The day\u2019s high reached $65.15, while a higher low at $63.95 reinforced buyer control. This advance may have completed a brief two-day pullback from Monday\u2019s swing high of $65.77, which itself followed a consolidation breakout last Thursday. The short length of the pullback signals strong underlying demand, with buyers stepping in quickly to support prices.Yesterday\u2019s decline completed a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent upswing, helping stabilize demand and setting up today\u2019s breakout. A second daily close above the 20-Day moving average now looks likely, which would mark the second such close in four days\u2014a constructive sign for the bulls. Sustained trade above this level strengthens the case for further upside attempts.Immediate resistance lies at this week\u2019s $65.77 high, reinforced by an anchored volume weighted average price (AVWAP) around $65.49. Beyond that, the next significant test appears near the 50-Day moving average, currently at $66.43 and declining. It has converged with a falling downtrend line. This convergence raises the significance of the area as a potential reversal point. Should momentum carry further, the 200-Day moving average near $67.85 offers the next logical upside target.Despite recent strength, the current move still forms part of a counter-trend rally within a broader downtrend. Historically, such rallies often stall when encountering major moving averages or prior support levels that have turned into resistance. As such, traders should be alert for selling pressure near the 50-Day or 200-Day averages, where the risk of reversal remains elevated.On a broader timeframe, crude oil triggered a weekly inside week bullish reversal after reclaiming the 20-Week moving average for the first time in four weeks. This development lends credibility to the short-term rally, suggesting that crude may continue higher in the near term even if resistance caps the upside.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar.

A wedge breakout adds bullish momentum, though $67\u2013$69 remains the decisive resistance zone to watch.WTI OilCrude oil extended higher on Tuesday, reaching $66.52 before pausing. The advance showed strength as price exceeded the prior swing high of $65.77 while also breaking above the anchored VWAP at $65.48. The 50-Day moving average at $66.15 and a key downtrend line were also surpassed intraday, both bullish developments. While crude may not close firmly above the 50-Day average, holding the breakout above the trendline signals improving momentum and raises the probability of testing higher levels. A confirmed daily close above $65.77 would validate the breakout and further strengthen the short-term bullish case.Two technical measures align near $67.16, creating a key area to monitor. First, an anchored VWAP level from the January swing high falls around that price. Second, a 100% measured move projection for a rising ABCD pattern also targets $67.16. Together, these levels provide a natural upside reference. A decisive daily close above the 50-Day average would further open the door toward the 200-Day moving average, now at $67.78. The long-term average coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $67.84, reinforcing this price zone as potentially significant resistance.The intraday move above the trendline also represents the first bullish signal for a breakout of a falling wedge pattern. The upper boundary of this wedge has now been breached, with the lower boundary tied to the recent swing low of $62.19. If the breakout is confirmed with continued strength, it suggests potential pattern-based targets at $71.33, marking a prior lower swing high, and at $78.44, which is the origin of the wedge. While these levels are not guaranteed, the wedge structure highlights the possibility of sustained upside momentum should key resistance levels be overcome.On the weekly timeframe, a bullish breakout also triggered as crude moved above last week\u2019s high of $65.77. Beyond the $67.78\u2013$67.84 resistance zone, the next notable confluence sits near $69.37. This area is defined by the overlap of the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement and the 161.8% measured projection of the rising ABCD pattern. This makes $69.37 a likely cap for near-term strength. If surpassed, however, bullish momentum would be confirmed as robust, leaving the door open to higher wedge targets over the coming weeks.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar.

Stricter sanctions on Iran herald tighter oil supplies in the coming months.Focus was also on potential bilateral trade talks between India and the U.S., after Washington slapped the South Asian country with 50% tariffs over its purchases of Russian oil.U.S. scrutiny invited European sanctions against a major Indian oil refinery, which could further disrupt global supplies. Saudi Arabia and Iraq were seen stopping oil shipments to Indian refiner Nayara this week.\u00a0India has so far shown little intent in stopping its buying of Russian oil, given the country\u2019s large dependence on energy imports.

were bullish for crude when he said the US would look at additional sanctions on Russia for prolonging the war in Ukraine. \u00a0Negative factors for crude on Tuesday were a stronger dollar and the decline in the S&P 500 to a 1-week low, which reduces confidence in the economic outlook and energy demand. \u00a0Also, the weakness in Tuesday's US economic news on construction spending and manufacturing activity is negative for energy demand and crude prices. \u00a0Reduced Russian crude output is tightening global oil supplies and is supportive of prices. \u00a0Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries have curbed Russia's crude-processing runs to 5.09 million bpd in the first 27 days of August, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25 years. \u00a0Tuesday's US economic news was mainly weaker-than-expected, a negative factor for energy demand and crude prices. \u00a0 The Aug ISM manufacturing index rose +0.7 to 48.7, weaker than expectations of 49.0. \u00a0Also, Jul construction spending fell -0.1% m/m, the third consecutive month construction spending has declined.Crude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. \u00a0US Treasury Secretary Bessent said Tuesday that the US \"will be examining sanctions on Russia very closely this week\" due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. \u00a0President Trump has threatened \"very big consequences\" if Russia doesn't come to the negotiating table. \u00a0Last Friday, German Chancellor Merz and French President Macron called for secondary sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine. \u00a0They said they will push for measures targeting \"companies from third countries that support Russia's war.\" \u00a0A decrease in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bullish for oil prices. \u00a0Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days fell by -18% w/w to 72.67 million bbl in the week ended August 29.Concerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices after OPEC+ on August 2 endorsed an additional 547,000 bpd increase in its crude production for September 1. \u00a0OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. \u00a0OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026. \u00a0OPEC+ will meet again on September 7. \u00a0OPEC July crude production fell by -20,000 bpd to 28.31 million bpd.Last Wednesday's weekly EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of August 22 were -5.2% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.3% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -14.8% below the 5-year seasonal average. \u00a0US crude oil production in the week ending August 22 rose by +0.4% w/w to 13.439 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12/6/2024.Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending August 29 rose by +1 to 412 rigs, just above the 3.75-year low of 410 rigs from August 1. \u00a0Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.25-year high of 627

If it moves ahead, this could worsen the expected surplus, particularly during the lean demand season,\" said ANZ Research analysts in a client note.OPEC+ had already agreed to raise output targets by about 2.2 million barrels per day from April to September, in addition to a 300,000 bpd quota increase for the United Arab Emirates.Over the past few months, despite the accelerating production increases, Middle Eastern oil prices have remained the strongest regional prices globally.

pressure from OPEC+ supply risks and rising US inventories, while natural gas shows bullish momentum from long-term support.Brent OilWTI OilNatural GasOil prices extended their decline as traders reacted to expectations of an OPEC+ output increase. Brent crude oil (BCO) dropped to $67 per barrel, while WTI crude oil (CL) dropped to $63.50. The weakness highlights growing concern that a higher supply could weigh on the market in the short term. Investors are cautious ahead of the weekend meeting, where producers may raise targets again.The possibility of OPEC+ adding more barrels comes after months of steady supply increases. The group already boosted output by 2.2 million barrels per day from April to September. Despite this, Middle Eastern oil prices stayed firm, giving key members confidence to push production higher. If OPEC+ raises quotas further, it could further increase the pressure on prices as markets adjust to growing supply.Meanwhile, US data added to the bearish tone. Crude inventories rose by 622,000 barrels, as seen in the chart below. The unexpected build signals weaker demand and slower refinery activity. The data reinforces downside momentum in oil markets, combined with OPEC+ supply risks. Crude prices may remain under pressure until traders see clearer signals on demand recovery and OPEC+ policy.The daily chart for WTI crude oil shows that the price failed to break above the 50-day SMA and continues to move lower. A break below $60 would extend the bearish momentum toward the $55.50 level.Since the 50-day SMA remains below the 200-day SMA and consolidation continues under the $70 region, bearish pressure is building. This price action indicates that the next move in WTI remains to the downside.The 4-hour chart for WTI crude oil shows that the price failed to break above the $65.50 level and continues to move lower. The consolidation over the past year is fueling a negative bias and indicates that the next move in WTI crude oil will likely be to the downside.The daily chart for natural gas (NG) shows that the price has found strong support in the $2.60 to $2.70 region. The rebound from this level has reached the resistance of the 50-day SMA, indicating that the next move in natural gas prices is pending.A break above $3.16 would extend the upside toward $3.60. Furthermore, a breakout above $3.60 could trigger a move toward the $5.00 level. The cup-and-handle pattern, along with the rebound from its neckline, suggests that natural gas is building bullish price action and is likely to move higher in the near term.The 4-hour chart for natural gas shows strong consolidation between the $2.60 and $4.70 levels. Prices are approaching the $3.18 region, and a break above this level would continue the rebound toward $3.60.Natural gas has remained in a consolidation zone for the past few months, which makes the next move uncertain. However, the bullish price action on the daily chart suggests that natural gas prices are likely to continue rising in the coming months.The daily chart for the US dollar index shows that the index is consolidating at the support of a bear flag pattern, indicating that bearish pressure is increasing near the 97 level. A break below 97 would complete the bear flag pattern and initiate a strong drop toward 96.The RSI is also fluctuating around the midline, reflecting price uncertainty and a lack of clear direction. The release of non-farm payrolls data on Friday will be the key driver for the next move in the US dollar index.The 4-hour chart for the US dollar index shows that prices are consolidating between the 97.20 and 98.60 levels. Consolidation below 98.60 increases short-term uncertainty.A breakout above 99.20 is required for a move toward the 100.50 level. However, as long as the index remains below 100.50, the next move in the US dollar index is likely to be lower.Muhammad Umair is a finance MBA and engineering PhD.

And I think this tells us just how noisy and obnoxious this market may end up being. With this being said, there are a lot of different things going on right in this area, with the $65 level offering support and resistance. The 50 day EMA sits there as well. We did see a lot of volume coming into the market during the Tuesday session. So, we\u2019ll see if the volume picks up during the Wednesday session.Ultimately, this is a market that I think is trying to find its range. And right now, we are in the midst of testing some barriers. So, it\u2019s a very difficult market to trade. I do think there is a little bit of a lid on oil though, because quite frankly, with Russia, OPEC and the United States all pumping out massive amounts of oil, it\u2019s going to be difficult for it to really take off to the upside. I think more back and forth sideways action makes more sense.The Brent markets have pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Wednesday in the early hours, and again, we\u2019ve pretty closely came to the bottom of the candlestick from the previous session. So, it shows you just how choppy and noisy this is going to be. I believe that crude oil markets, Brent markets, especially will be very range bound, with the $67 level offering an obvious support level at the moment.The 50 day EMA is right here in the middle of the mix and above we have the $69.50 region offering resistance followed by the 200 day EMA.

The potential move, currently under discussion by eight key members, could unwind a second layer of output cuts far earlier than planned\u2014raising concerns of a looser supply environment heading into the final stretch of Q3.Sources familiar with the talks say the proposed hike would add back roughly 1.65 million barrels per day, or 1.6% of global demand, as OPEC+ eyes regaining lost market share. This follows a previously agreed 2.2 million bpd quota increase from April to September, along with a 300,000 bpd uplift for the UAE.However, actual production has lagged pledges. Some members are offsetting past overproduction, while others remain constrained by limited capacity. An official announcement this Sunday could clarify whether these production targets will be fully met\u2014or merely symbolic.Wednesday\u2019s 1.77% decline pushed NYMEX WTI futures back to $64.43, just under the $65.10 resistance level marked by the August high. The chart shows prices briefly testing above both the 50-day ($64.40) and 200-day ($63.29) moving averages before retreating\u2014highlighting near-term seller strength.Traders will now be watching the $65.41\u2013$66.18 resistance band, which represents a major hurdle for any sustained bullish momentum. A close above $66.18 opens up room toward the $68.70 zone, while downside support sits near the 200-day SMA and recent swing low at $61.12.A temporary boost from U.S. sanctions on a network smuggling Iranian oil was quickly overshadowed by weak demand signals. U.S. manufacturing shrank for a sixth month, reflecting declining industrial consumption. Meanwhile, early inventory estimates suggest a 3.4 million barrel draw last week, but broader macro concerns are capping bullish enthusiasm.The market is leaning bearish heading into the OPEC+ meeting. Unless the group delays or waters down the proposed October hike, supply pressures are likely to outweigh near-term inventory draws. Price action remains technically capped below key resistance, and without a breakout above $66.18, sellers maintain the upper hand.Traders should stay alert to headline risk from the weekend talks and watch the 200-day moving average at $63.29 as the next line of defense if bearish sentiment deepens.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Natural gas markets mirrored the volatility, with investors eyeing shifts in production and export patterns.Attention now turns to this week\u2019s OPEC+ meeting, where decisions on output beyond September could define the near-term trajectory of global energy prices amid heightened uncertainty.Natural gas is trading at $2.97, holding above the 50-EMA at $2.94 and supported by an ascending channel that has guided price higher since late August. The recovery followed a breakout from the prior descending channel, signaling a shift in momentum.Key resistance sits near $3.06, followed by $3.17, while support rests at $2.94 and $2.85. The RSI at 50 shows balanced momentum, suggesting neither buyers nor sellers have firm control, while the MACD is flattening, hinting at slowing strength but no clear reversal yet.As long as natural gas holds above $2.94, the bias leans toward testing $3.06\u2013$3.17. A drop below $2.94 could open the door to $2.85 and $2.78.WTI crude oil is trading near $65.30, breaking above a key descending trendline that had capped prices through August. The move is reinforced by support at $64.55, with the 50-EMA at $64.02 and the 200-EMA at $64.66 now turning into a support cluster.Momentum is improving: the RSI at 67 approaches overbought but signals strong buying, while the MACD remains positive with widening lines. Price action shows higher lows forming since mid-August, building a constructive base. If crude sustains above $65.44, the next upside targets sit at $66.00 and $66.73.A failure to hold above $64.55 could invite a pullback toward $63.64, though the broader structure favors continuation higher.Brent crude is trading around $68.73, extending gains within an ascending channel that has guided prices since mid-August.

If Brent sustains above $68.70, the next upside targets are $69.14 and $70.00, with a potential extension toward $70.97.On the downside, slipping below $67.11 could trigger a pullback toward $66.40.

A close above that level could trigger an acceleration toward $68.70\u2014just below the major top at $69.69.Support remains layered, with $64.05 now acting as the first technical floor. A failure to hold this level would expose prices to a pullback toward the 200-day moving average at $63.28.

Ukrainian drone strikes have taken out at least 17% of Russia\u2019s refining capacity\u2014roughly 1.1 million barrels per day\u2014according to Reuters. President Zelenskyy\u2019s vow for \u201cdeep strikes\u201d suggests the threat to infrastructure is ongoing.Meanwhile, diplomatic tensions are adding further pressure. The U.S. has tightened tariffs on Indian imports, attributing the move to India\u2019s continued Russian crude purchases, prompting criticism from New Delhi. Though Washington has so far avoided sanctioning China\u2014Russia\u2019s top oil buyer\u2014geopolitical risks are now firmly embedded in oil price projections.Traders are also focused on the upcoming September 7 OPEC+ meeting, where eight core members\u2014including Saudi Arabia and Russia\u2014will assess output strategy. While the group recently accelerated the rollback of a 2.2 million bpd cut, analysts at ING expect no major policy shift in October. The prevailing view is that supply will remain tight, and the larger risk lies in potential reinstatement of deeper cuts if the market softens.SEB Commodities, however, warned in a client note that prices could average as low as $55 in Q4 unless OPEC+ intervenes again. Such bearish estimates are currently being counterbalanced by physical disruptions and geopolitical tensions.On the demand side, attention is turning to U.S. labor data due later this week, which could influence the Fed\u2019s next rate decision. A weaker jobs report would bolster expectations for monetary easing at the September 16\u201317 meeting. A rate cut would likely pressure the dollar and support demand for dollar-denominated commodities like crude.With technical breakouts aligning with tightening physical supply and potential Fed easing, the near-term outlook for oil remains bullish. If WTI clears $66.18, traders should prepare for a fast move toward $68.70, with supply risks and macro policy shifts offering a supportive backdrop. However, any failure to hold above the 50-day average could reverse momentum sharply.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Traders remain focused on OPEC+ deliberations over potentially unwinding 1.65 million barrels per day of production cuts, equal to about 1.6% of global demand, a move that could weigh further on prices.U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 0.6 million barrels against forecasts for a 3.4 million-barrel draw, underscoring signs of softer demand.At the same time, natural gas prices have held firmer as geopolitical tensions heighten risk premiums, leaving energy markets caught between oversupply concerns and uncertain demand conditions.Natural gas futures are holding firm above $3.09 after a steady rebound from late August lows. Price action is supported by an ascending trendline and the 50-EMA at $2.99, while the 200-EMA at $2.96 has now turned into a strong base. Momentum remains positive, with RSI near 66, suggesting buyers are in control but approaching overbought levels.Immediate resistance is seen at $3.13, followed by $3.22 and $3.29. A break above these levels could extend the rally further. On the downside, $3.03 is the first support, with the trendline and $2.96 providing deeper backing.Overall, natural gas maintains a bullish bias, but traders may want to watch for a pullback before fresh upside continuation.WTI crude oil broke below its ascending trendline and the 50-EMA near $64.30, shifting momentum to the downside.

On the upside, recovery above $63.70 could bring a retest of $64.70, but the broader bias remains weak unless buyers reclaim both EMAs.In short, bears remain in control, but oversold momentum suggests a possible short-term bounce before the next decisive move.Brent crude slipped below its rising channel support, now trading near $66.80. Both the 50-EMA ($67.86) and 200-EMA ($67.58) sit above price, confirming downside pressure after last week\u2019s rejection at $69.27.

If these levels fail, the decline could extend further. On the upside, any rebound needs a close back above $67.50 to shift sentiment.

The bond bounce and Federal Reserve easing speculation added to Alphabet's near 10% surge on its antitrust win to lift Wall Street stocks again on Wednesday, with index futures up again ahead of Thursday's bell. The day ahead brings another stream of labor market updates ahead of Friday's critical August payrolls report.* Fed futures rallied to fully price a quarter point interest rate cut later this month after news of falling U.S. job openings added to a downbeat readout from the central bank's 'Beige Book' on economic conditions and relatively dovish soundings from Fed officials. Two-year Treasury yields hit a four-month low. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on Thursday to consider President Donald Trump's nominee to the Fed board Stephen Miran while central bankers around the world fretted about potential threats to Fed independence.* Long-dated government bond yields around the world pulled back from record or multi-year highs on Thursday in tandem with the 10 basis point slide in 30-year Treasuries from yesterday's 5% peak, with Japan's 30-year equivalent also getting a break after a bond sale there drew enough demand to calm the horses despite being the lowest bid-to-offer rate since June. UK 30-year gilts rallied too with a 20bp drop in yields from Wednesday's highs. The dollar was firmer.* Japan and the United States are in the final stages of talks to implement lower tariffs on Japanese automobile imports within 10-14 days after a U.S. presidential executive order. Japanese stocks rallied, but Chinese stocks sharply underperformed generally higher world stocks - falling the most in nearly five months after media reports of possible regulatory curbs on speculation.Today's column explores why the so-called 'Fed put' may not work for long-maturity bonds and why lower central bank rates could actually aggravate the problem.Today's Market Minute* Donald Trump's administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to swiftly hear a bid to preserve his sweeping tariffs pursued under a 1977 law meant for emergencies after a lower court invalidated most of the levies that have been central to the Republican president's economic and trade agenda.", "analysis": 1}, "156": {"type": "news", "title": "Azule Energy to invest $5bn in Angola\u2019s oil and gas projects", "source": "finance.yahoo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/azule-energy-invest-5bn-angola-092931162.html", "date": "2025-09-04T09:29:31.000Z", "body": "Azule Energy, a joint venture (JV) between Eni and bp, is set to invest an additional $5bn (Kz4.6trn) in Angola's oil and gas sector over the next four to five years, reported Reuters, citing Eni chief operating officer Guido Brusco.This move is expected to sustain the country's oil production above one million barrels per day (mbbl/d) and reflects the significant overhaul of Angola's regulatory regime to attract new investments.The investment will be allocated to new and existing projects, matching the funds injected since Azule Energy's inception three years ago.On the sidelines of an oil and gas conference, Brusco said: \"We have in the next four to five years 18 wells to be drilled on which two-thirds are operated by Azule and one-third operated by others.\u201dIn addition to its commitment to Angola, Eni has made strides in Mozambique, becoming the first exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the nation in 2022 with its Coral South floating platform.Recently, Eni received approval from the Mozambican Government for the development plan of the Coral Norte (North) floating LNG (FLNG) platform, which is expected to produce 3.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG for three decades, effectively doubling LNG output from the offshore Rovuma Basin.About Coral North FLNG, Brusco said: \"We are still waiting for one partner approval, but we have government approval, we have the financial institutions, the loan is there, ready, the project is technically and financially strong.\"We do not foresee problems, and before the year-end you will hear something.\"The majority of the current LNG production is earmarked for the European market.Meanwhile, southern Africa is also anticipating the commencement of TotalEnergies' long-delayed onshore LNG project.Earlier in July, Azule Energy unveiled a significant gas discovery at the Gajajeira-01 exploration well in Block 1/14 in the Lower Congo Basin offshore Angola.\"Azule Energy to invest $5bn in Angola\u2019s oil and gas projects\" was originally created and published by Offshore Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\u00a0The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Strong earnings \u2026 low oil \u2026 and importantly, the 10-year Treasury yield staying well-behaved (<4.5%),\u201d Raymond James wrote.The firm highlighted that second-quarter earnings were \u201cremarkably strong, and remarkably broad in strength,\u201d while oil prices are down about 10% year to date.\u00a0Yet the most significant support has come from U.S. Treasury yields, which have remained below 4.5% despite \u201cclear signs of at least modest inflation impacts from tariffs, increasing Treasury General Account (TGA), decreasing reverse repo, and accelerating loan growth.\u201dRaymond James noted that internationally, 10-year yields have risen this year even as global economies slowed and inflation moderated.\u00a0By contrast, in the U.S., yields have \u201ctrended down, even as economic growth has been resilient, and inflation has not dis-inflated as it has in the rest of the world.\u201dThe report credited Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s focus on yields as a contributing factor.\u00a0\u201cSo far, his focus has worked, with almost assuredly a very positive impact on equities this year,\u201d the analysts wrote.Looking ahead, Raymond James concluded that \u201cthe U.S. equity market likely needs yields to stay <4.5% as inflation picks up modestly, corporate earnings to keep moving in the right direction, and oil/energy to remain subdued.

That buying spree, Goldman noted, has been the primary driver of a 94% rally in gold prices since 2022.While Goldman\u2019s base case implies only modest positive returns across broad commodity indices over the next year, it underscored that \u201ccommodities as a hedge against inflation (and other tail) risks is increasingly relevant in the current environment.\u201dAgainst that backdrop, the bank sees gold not only as a defensive asset but also as the clearest beneficiary of any erosion in U.S. institutional credibility.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

However, this is a market that has been in a range for a while.WTI OilBrent OilThe light sweet crude oil market has rallied a bit here on Monday in limited thin electronic trading. What I find interesting is that we have found the 50 day EMA again, which sits right at $65 level. The $65 level, of course, is an area where we have seen both support and resistance, so I\u2019ll be watching that very closely for a potential turnaround. If we can break above the $65 level rather handily, then we could go looking at the $67 level. A pullback from here just means that we continue with the same consolidation pattern that we\u2019ve been in for the last five or six trading sessions, which is very possible at this point.Brent markets have rallied as well, but we are sitting here at the 50 day EMA also, with the $67 level underneath offering support and the $66 level underneath there also offering support. To the upside, the $70 level is a potential target as it is a large round, psychologically significant figure and an area that sits just below the crucial 200 day EMA. With that being said, the market is very noisy, but I think more than anything else, the market is sideways. And I think that\u2019s how you have to look at it.

If this is a war, they will raise another 1.6mbpd at their next September 7th meeting and more in 2026. This September meeting is currently the last scheduled meeting for 2025, but can change. OPEC Meetings schedule here.In the face of continued successful Ukrainian attacks on Russian facilities, we have an underappreciated war risk premium on supply. Yes, Russian output is stillborn with US/EU sanctions, however, should the political tensions warm up, this would instantly bring focus back to how much Russia can add back to global legitimate supplies.Meanwhile, Iran comes back into the picture.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is testing a resistance cluster defined by the 50-day moving average at $64.40 and the long-term 50% level at $64.56.At 10:28 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures are trading $64.65, up $0.64 or 1.00%.A breakout above this zone could unlock upside momentum toward last week\u2019s swing top at $65.10, followed by a minor pivot at $65.41. The next major objective is $66.18, which marks the 50% retracement of the $56.09 to $76.27 trading range. A sustained move through that level could drive prices toward heavier resistance between $68.70 and $69.69.On the downside, the 200-day moving average at $63.28 remains the key support level. With major players sidelined for the holiday, traders are treating price action with caution. Thin volume increases the likelihood of false breakouts and intraday traps.From a supply standpoint, the market remains heavy. U.S. crude production rose to a record 13.58 million barrels per day in June, according to the EIA, up 133,000 bpd. OPEC+ is set to increase output by 547,000 bpd in September, and analysts suggest the group may not be finished with supply hikes.Both WTI and Brent declined more than 6% in August, breaking a four-month winning streak as supply growth outpaced demand. A Reuters poll showed limited upside, with WTI expected to average $64.65 and Brent $67.65 in 2025. For now, rising production and soft demand projections continue to weigh on sentiment.Russia-Ukraine tensions remain a factor, offering a modest geopolitical risk premium. Russia\u2019s weekly crude exports fell to a four-week low of 2.72 million bpd, impacted by intensified cross-border strikes. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy vowed retaliation following fresh attacks on power facilities.While no major supply outages have materialized, risks remain elevated. Markets are also monitoring a regional summit in Beijing involving Russia, India, and China ahead of the September 7 OPEC+ meeting.WTI\u2019s near-term setup looks technically bullish, but conviction is lacking without participation from large funds. A break above $66.18 on stronger volume could pave the way to upper resistance zones. Until then, rising output from the U.S. and OPEC+ continues to limit upside. The oil prices forecast remains neutral to bearish unless price clears key levels with confirmation post-holiday.More Information in our Light Crude Oil Futures.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

The broader tone remains hesitant, with traders waiting for firmer signals from both fundamentals and the technical picture.OPEC+ continues to quietly increase production, clawing back barrels without rattling prices too much. While the group hasn\u2019t made aggressive moves, supply has been drifting higher over recent weeks, weighing slightly on sentiment. Traders are also squaring up ahead of the September 7 meeting, though early signals suggest no major quota changes. With seasonal demand waning, this steady return of OPEC+ supply is starting to tip the balance.Russian crude exports picked back up after brief disruptions. The Druzhba pipeline, which supplies Hungary and Slovakia, resumed service following a Ukrainian drone strike. At the same time, Moscow boosted its August exports from western ports by 200,000 barrels per day, a move that softened some of the geopolitical premium built into the market. Even so, Russian infrastructure remains in the crosshairs, and traders haven\u2019t dismissed the risk of fresh outages.The latest U.S. inventory data\u00a0showed a 2.4 million barrel draw, stronger than the expected 1.9 million. That helped briefly lift prices midweek. But with the summer driving season wrapping up, gasoline demand is underwhelming and traders aren\u2019t treating the draw as the start of a sustained trend. Freight and industrial demand still look steady, but not strong enough to push the tape on their own.The 52-week moving average at $63.35 is the most important line in the sand. Crude has now held above it for two straight weeks, and as long as that holds, the tone stays neutral-to-constructive.

But on a year-on-year basis, exports south of the border were still down over 10%.However, imports from the U.S. continued to fall and dropped 2.2% in July, taking its trade surplus with the U.S. by over 80% to C$6.7 billion in July, its highest since March.The Canadian dollar was trading down 0.21% to 1.3823 to the U.S. dollar, or 72.34 U.S. cents, after the trade data was released. Bond yields on the government\u2019s two-year bonds improved and were down 0.1 basis point at 2.61%.The recent GDP data which showed that the economy contracted by 1.6% has led money markets to bet that a rate cut in September is coming. Markets are now betting on an almost 70% chance of a rate cut on Sept. 17.Overall exports rose by 0.9% to C$61.86 billion in July while imports slowed 0.7% to C$66.80 billion, StatsCan said.Exports of energy products posted the biggest increase in July of 4.2% and exports of motor vehicle sand parts increased 6.6%, it said, adding that lower exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products partially offset the overall increase in exports in July.Exports of aluminum, which has a 50% tariff from the U.S., dropped over 30% in July. Steel exports, although marginally down in July, were down over 25% year-to-date.Exports to countries other than the United States were down 8.6% in July, a second consecutive monthly decline and imports from countries excluding the U.S. increased 1.3%.The best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

A sustained move below this line would signal further weakness, with $61.12 as the next technical target.Conversely, a rebound above $63.30 could attract dip buyers, though any rally faces resistance at $64.40 and again at $66.18, which could be the trigger for a breakout toward $68.70.The bearish tone in crude markets reflects rising expectations that OPEC+ may announce another output increase at its Sunday meeting. According to sources cited by Reuters, eight member nations are pushing for additional supply hikes starting in October. This follows the group\u2019s decision earlier this year to raise production targets by 2.2 million barrels per day between April and September, along with a 300,000 bpd quota bump for the UAE.PVM analyst Tamas Varga noted that a fresh production hike would mark a shift in OPEC+ strategy toward reclaiming lost market share rather than supporting prices. Despite aggressive output increases, Middle Eastern crude grades have remained among the strongest globally, giving producers like Saudi Arabia more confidence to open the taps.Domestic economic data is also weighing on oil sentiment. Job openings fell to a 10-month low in July, pointing to a softening labor market and reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates this month. A dovish Fed could ease recession fears but also signals tepid demand growth.Meanwhile, traders await official U.S. crude inventory data later Thursday. Preliminary figures from the American Petroleum Institute show a surprise 622,000-barrel build in crude stocks for the week ending August 29\u2014suggesting demand may not be as strong as expected. Any confirmation from the Energy Information Administration could amplify selling pressure.With technicals breaking down, OPEC+ signaling higher output, and U.S. inventories rising, the weight of evidence leans bearish for crude oil in the near term.

A wedge breakout adds bullish momentum, though $67\u2013$69 remains the decisive resistance zone to watch.WTI OilCrude oil extended higher on Tuesday, reaching $66.52 before pausing. The advance showed strength as price exceeded the prior swing high of $65.77 while also breaking above the anchored VWAP at $65.48. The 50-Day moving average at $66.15 and a key downtrend line were also surpassed intraday, both bullish developments. While crude may not close firmly above the 50-Day average, holding the breakout above the trendline signals improving momentum and raises the probability of testing higher levels. A confirmed daily close above $65.77 would validate the breakout and further strengthen the short-term bullish case.Two technical measures align near $67.16, creating a key area to monitor. First, an anchored VWAP level from the January swing high falls around that price. Second, a 100% measured move projection for a rising ABCD pattern also targets $67.16. Together, these levels provide a natural upside reference. A decisive daily close above the 50-Day average would further open the door toward the 200-Day moving average, now at $67.78. The long-term average coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $67.84, reinforcing this price zone as potentially significant resistance.The intraday move above the trendline also represents the first bullish signal for a breakout of a falling wedge pattern. The upper boundary of this wedge has now been breached, with the lower boundary tied to the recent swing low of $62.19. If the breakout is confirmed with continued strength, it suggests potential pattern-based targets at $71.33, marking a prior lower swing high, and at $78.44, which is the origin of the wedge. While these levels are not guaranteed, the wedge structure highlights the possibility of sustained upside momentum should key resistance levels be overcome.On the weekly timeframe, a bullish breakout also triggered as crude moved above last week\u2019s high of $65.77. Beyond the $67.78\u2013$67.84 resistance zone, the next notable confluence sits near $69.37. This area is defined by the overlap of the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement and the 161.8% measured projection of the rising ABCD pattern. This makes $69.37 a likely cap for near-term strength. If surpassed, however, bullish momentum would be confirmed as robust, leaving the door open to higher wedge targets over the coming weeks.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar.

Traders have boosted wagers on a Fed rate cut as Trump publicly campaigns for lower borrowing costs and Powell strikes a more dovish tone.Goldman Sachs outlined a range of possible outcomes for gold, with a baseline forecast for a surge to $4,000 an ounce by mid-2026; a so-called tail-risk scenario of $4,500; and an estimate of almost $5,000 if just 1% of the privately-owned US Treasury market were to flow into gold.\u201cA scenario where Fed independence is damaged would likely lead to higher inflation, lower stock and long-dated bond prices, and an erosion of the dollar\u2019s reserve currency status,\u201d wrote analysts including Samantha Dart.While Goldman\u2019s report focused on commodities, the JPMorgan team studied moves across various assets for signs of the \u201cFed independence trade\u201d playing out in markets.

Steve HollandWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President\u00a0Donald Trump told European leaders on Thursday that Europe must stop buying Russian oil that he said is helping Moscow fund its war against Ukraine, a White House official said, striking a combative tone amid\u00a0slow diplomatic progress to end the fighting.Trump joined a call of the \"Coalition of the Willing\" countries, led by French President Emmanuel Macron, who were meeting in Paris on security guarantees for Kyiv in the event of a peace deal with Russia.\"President Macron and European leaders called President Trump into their \u2018Coalition of the Willing\u2019 meeting. President Trump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war - as Russia received 1.1 billion euros in fuel sales from the EU in one year,\" the official said.The European Commission has proposed legislation to phase out EU imports of Russian oil and gas by January 1, 2028, as Brussels seeks to sever its decades-old energy relations with Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Most European countries stopped importing Russian crude in 2022 and Russian fuel in 2023. It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to crude imports by Hungary and Slovakia, which have continued, or imports of fuel made from Russian crude that is refined in third countries, such as India.Trump also said in the call that \"European leaders must place economic pressure on China for funding Russia\u2019s war efforts,\" the official said.Reuters was first to report Trump\u2019s comments.Trump has been frustrated at his inability to bring a halt to the fighting in Ukraine after he initially predicted he would be able to end the war swiftly when he took office last January.He has withheld new sanctions on Russia and China, a top Russian oil buyer. But he has ramped up tariffs on U.S. imports from India, another top Russian energy consumer. Trump shrugged off talks this week between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, but also said the leaders might be conspiring against the U.S.The U.S. president also continues to press Europeans to absorb more of the burden for their defense and is reluctant to commit more American support to a war that he wants to end.The White House official said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were among the leaders on the call.\"The \u2019Coalition of the Willing\u2019 meeting was on security guarantees for Ukraine. President Trump questioned their seriousness while they continue to fuel Russia\u2019s economy and war. The president made clear that this is not his war, and the Europeans must step up as well,\" the official said.The official gave no details on the discussion around security guarantees, but Trump has previously expressed support for Ukraine without making a specific pledge. Macron said on Thursday that 26 nations have pledged to provide Ukraine the postwar support of an international force on land, sea, and in the air.Trump has warned he could impose sanctions on countries that buy oil from Russia, but did not impose direct tariffs on Moscow when he announced broad tariffs on dozens of countries in April.\u00a0\u00a0The best opportunities often hide in plain sight\u2014buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

[EIA/S] [API/S]That was a surprise build in crude stocks compared with the 2.0-million-barrel withdrawal analysts forecast in a Reuters poll and was higher than the 0.6-million-barrel increase that market sources said the American Petroleum Institute trade group cited in its figures on Wednesday.\"This is a little bit of a bearish report with that crude build,\" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital.The EIA and API reported inventory data a day later than usual due to the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday.Eight members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia in OPEC+ will consider further increases to production in October at a meeting on Sunday, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.A potential OPEC+ production hike would send a strong signal that regaining market share takes priority over price support, said Tamas Varga, a senior analyst at\u00a0PVM Oil Associates brokerage and consulting firm.OPEC+ has already agreed to raise output targets by about 2.2 million barrels per day from April to September, in addition to a 300,000-bpd quota increase for the United Arab Emirates.\u00a0ECONOMIC DATAIn the world\u2019s biggest economy, some shaky U.S. macroeconomic data that showed new applications for jobless benefits increased more than expected last week, supporting expectations the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates this month.Investors have viewed the Fed\u2019s September meeting as a lock for a quarter percentage point cut in what is now a 4.25% to 4.5% federal funds interest rate target range.Central banks, like the Fed, use interest rates to control inflation. Lower rates reduce consumer borrowing costs and can boost economic growth and demand for oil.Questions about Fed independence took center stage on Thursday as Trump\u2019s economic advisor Stephen Miran testified at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on his nomination to the U.S. central bank\u2019s seven-member governing board, with lawmakers from both parties pressing him for a commitment to be politically neutral.In Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, leading economic institutes trimmed growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026, citing U.S. tariffs and delays to the boost from higher public spending in an export-reliant economy struggling to regain momentum.U.S. President Donald Trump told European leaders on Thursday that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that he said is helping Moscow fund its war against Ukraine, a White House official said.Any reduction in the amount of crude Russia may export could boost prices. Russia was the second biggest producer of crude in 2024 after the U.S.Moscow, however, is not waiting for Europe to buy more oil. Russia\u2019s largest oil producer Rosneft has secured an additional deal on supply of 2.5 million metric tons of oil per year to China via Kazakhstan, Interfax news agency quoted Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev as saying.In Venezuela, an OPEC member sanctioned by the U.S., oil exports rose to a nine-month high of 900,000 bpd last month after U.S. oil major Chevron received a license that has allowed the country\u2019s crude to return to the U.S. market.Ask WarrenAI, our powerful AI financial research assistant.

added to Wednesday's losses on concerns of a global oil supply glut following a report from Reuters that OPEC+ is considering an increase in its crude production levels. \u00a0Crude prices remained lower after weekly EIA crude inventories unexpectedly rose. \u00a0Losses in gasoline prices were limited after weekly EIA gasoline supplies fell more than expected to a 9-month low.Thursday's global economic news was mainly weaker-than-expected, a negative factor for energy demand and crude prices. \u00a0The US Aug ADP employment change rose +54,000, weaker than expectations of +68,000. \u00a0Also, US weekly initial unemployment claims rose by +8,000 to a 10-week high of 237,000, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 230,000. \u00a0In addition, Eurozone July retail sales

51.1 and the strongest pace of expansion in six months.Reduced Russian crude output is tightening global oil supplies and is supportive of prices. \u00a0Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries have curbed Russia's crude-processing runs to 5.09 million bpd in the first 27 days of August, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25 years. \u00a0Crude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. \u00a0US Treasury Secretary Bessent said Tuesday that the US \"will be examining sanctions on Russia very closely this week\" due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. \u00a0President Trump has threatened \"very big consequences\" if Russia doesn't come to the negotiating table. \u00a0Last Friday, German Chancellor Merz and French President Macron called for secondary sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine. \u00a0They said they will push for measures targeting \"companies from third countries that support Russia's war.\" \u00a0A decrease in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bullish for oil prices. \u00a0Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days fell by -18% w/w to 72.67 million bbl in the week ended August 29.Concerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices after OPEC+ on August 2 endorsed an additional 547,000 bpd increase in its crude production for September 1. \u00a0OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. \u00a0OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026. \u00a0OPEC+ will meet again on September 7 to discuss crude production levels. \u00a0OPEC Aug crude production rose by +400,000 bpd to 28.55 million bpd, the highest in over two years.Thursday's weekly EIA report was mainly bearish for crude and products. \u00a0EIA crude inventories unexpectedly rose +2.4 million bbl versus expectations of a -1.9 million draw. \u00a0Also, EIA distillate stockpiles unexpectedly rose +1.7 million bbl versus expectations of a -1.7 million draw. \u00a0In addition, crude supplies at Cushing, the delivery point of WTI futures, rose by +1.59 million bbl. \u00a0On the positive side, EIA gasoline inventories fell -3.8 million bbl to a 9-month low, a larger draw than expectations of -1.4 million bbl. \u00a0Thursday's weekly EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of August 29 were -3.8% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -1.6% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -13.2% below the 5-year seasonal average. \u00a0US crude oil production in the week ending August 29 fell by -0.1% w/w to 13.423 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12/6/2024.Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending August 29 rose by +1 to 412 rigs, just above the 3.75-year low of 410 rigs from August 1. \u00a0Over the past 2.5 years,

pressure from OPEC+ supply risks and rising US inventories, while natural gas shows bullish momentum from long-term support.Brent OilWTI OilNatural GasOil prices extended their decline as traders reacted to expectations of an OPEC+ output increase. Brent crude oil (BCO) dropped to $67 per barrel, while WTI crude oil (CL) dropped to $63.50. The weakness highlights growing concern that a higher supply could weigh on the market in the short term. Investors are cautious ahead of the weekend meeting, where producers may raise targets again.The possibility of OPEC+ adding more barrels comes after months of steady supply increases. The group already boosted output by 2.2 million barrels per day from April to September. Despite this, Middle Eastern oil prices stayed firm, giving key members confidence to push production higher. If OPEC+ raises quotas further, it could further increase the pressure on prices as markets adjust to growing supply.Meanwhile, US data added to the bearish tone. Crude inventories rose by 622,000 barrels, as seen in the chart below. The unexpected build signals weaker demand and slower refinery activity. The data reinforces downside momentum in oil markets, combined with OPEC+ supply risks. Crude prices may remain under pressure until traders see clearer signals on demand recovery and OPEC+ policy.The daily chart for WTI crude oil shows that the price failed to break above the 50-day SMA and continues to move lower. A break below $60 would extend the bearish momentum toward the $55.50 level.Since the 50-day SMA remains below the 200-day SMA and consolidation continues under the $70 region, bearish pressure is building. This price action indicates that the next move in WTI remains to the downside.The 4-hour chart for WTI crude oil shows that the price failed to break above the $65.50 level and continues to move lower. The consolidation over the past year is fueling a negative bias and indicates that the next move in WTI crude oil will likely be to the downside.The daily chart for natural gas (NG) shows that the price has found strong support in the $2.60 to $2.70 region. The rebound from this level has reached the resistance of the 50-day SMA, indicating that the next move in natural gas prices is pending.A break above $3.16 would extend the upside toward $3.60. Furthermore, a breakout above $3.60 could trigger a move toward the $5.00 level. The cup-and-handle pattern, along with the rebound from its neckline, suggests that natural gas is building bullish price action and is likely to move higher in the near term.The 4-hour chart for natural gas shows strong consolidation between the $2.60 and $4.70 levels. Prices are approaching the $3.18 region, and a break above this level would continue the rebound toward $3.60.Natural gas has remained in a consolidation zone for the past few months, which makes the next move uncertain. However, the bullish price action on the daily chart suggests that natural gas prices are likely to continue rising in the coming months.The daily chart for the US dollar index shows that the index is consolidating at the support of a bear flag pattern, indicating that bearish pressure is increasing near the 97 level. A break below 97 would complete the bear flag pattern and initiate a strong drop toward 96.The RSI is also fluctuating around the midline, reflecting price uncertainty and a lack of clear direction. The release of non-farm payrolls data on Friday will be the key driver for the next move in the US dollar index.The 4-hour chart for the US dollar index shows that prices are consolidating between the 97.20 and 98.60 levels. Consolidation below 98.60 increases short-term uncertainty.A breakout above 99.20 is required for a move toward the 100.50 level. However, as long as the index remains below 100.50, the next move in the US dollar index is likely to be lower.Muhammad Umair is a finance MBA and engineering PhD.

This decline followed a second consecutive rejection at the 50-Day moving average after an attempted breakout of a falling wedge pattern failed. An earlier reclaim of the AVWAP indicator also proved temporary, as two intraday moves above it quickly reversed, signaling resistance.The daily high of $64.28 aligned with resistance at the 20-Day average, while the higher swing low at $63.58 failed to hold as support. Each is a short-term bearish sign. These developments reinforce the view that crude remains in a downtrend from the June swing high. Price action continues to trace a falling wedge formation, but near-term weakness places focus on the recent swing low of $62.19. A break below this level would expose the next potential support zone near the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement at $60.66, a level that also aligns with prior consolidation support and the wedge\u2019s lower boundary.On the weekly timeframe, crude has formed a bearish outside reversal pattern that will be confirmed on a weekly close below last week\u2019s low of $65.58. Current price action suggests the week could finish in the lower third of the trading range, underscoring downside momentum. The 20-Week moving average, now at $65.29, remains a significant level of resistance. Multiple failed attempts to reclaim it highlight the strength of overhead supply.For sentiment to shift, crude oil would need a daily close above the 20-Day moving average, followed by a recovery above the AVWAP indicator at $65.50. This level has repeatedly marked support in recent months but has now flipped to resistance. Only a decisive move through these hurdles would reduce the risk of a deeper decline and reintroduce the possibility of testing the 200-Day moving average, currently higher at $67.78. Until then, momentum favors sellers, with downside targets still in play.For a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our\u00a0economic calendar.

And I think this tells us just how noisy and obnoxious this market may end up being. With this being said, there are a lot of different things going on right in this area, with the $65 level offering support and resistance. The 50 day EMA sits there as well. We did see a lot of volume coming into the market during the Tuesday session. So, we\u2019ll see if the volume picks up during the Wednesday session.Ultimately, this is a market that I think is trying to find its range. And right now, we are in the midst of testing some barriers. So, it\u2019s a very difficult market to trade. I do think there is a little bit of a lid on oil though, because quite frankly, with Russia, OPEC and the United States all pumping out massive amounts of oil, it\u2019s going to be difficult for it to really take off to the upside. I think more back and forth sideways action makes more sense.The Brent markets have pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Wednesday in the early hours, and again, we\u2019ve pretty closely came to the bottom of the candlestick from the previous session. So, it shows you just how choppy and noisy this is going to be. I believe that crude oil markets, Brent markets, especially will be very range bound, with the $67 level offering an obvious support level at the moment.The 50 day EMA is right here in the middle of the mix and above we have the $69.50 region offering resistance followed by the 200 day EMA.

The potential move, currently under discussion by eight key members, could unwind a second layer of output cuts far earlier than planned\u2014raising concerns of a looser supply environment heading into the final stretch of Q3.Sources familiar with the talks say the proposed hike would add back roughly 1.65 million barrels per day, or 1.6% of global demand, as OPEC+ eyes regaining lost market share. This follows a previously agreed 2.2 million bpd quota increase from April to September, along with a 300,000 bpd uplift for the UAE.However, actual production has lagged pledges. Some members are offsetting past overproduction, while others remain constrained by limited capacity.

A close above $66.18 opens up room toward the $68.70 zone, while downside support sits near the 200-day SMA and recent swing low at $61.12.A temporary boost from U.S. sanctions on a network smuggling Iranian oil was quickly overshadowed by weak demand signals. U.S. manufacturing shrank for a sixth month, reflecting declining industrial consumption. Meanwhile, early inventory estimates suggest a 3.4 million barrel draw last week, but broader macro concerns are capping bullish enthusiasm.The market is leaning bearish heading into the OPEC+ meeting. Unless the group delays or waters down the proposed October hike, supply pressures are likely to outweigh near-term inventory draws. Price action remains technically capped below key resistance, and without a breakout above $66.18, sellers maintain the upper hand.Traders should stay alert to headline risk from the weekend talks and watch the 200-day moving average at $63.29 as the next line of defense if bearish sentiment deepens.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Whether that transpires could be determined by Friday\u2019s critical August employment report.\u00a0More on that below. In my column today, I look at the explosion of gold as a share of central banks\u2019 reserve assets, which is now bigger than that of the euro and U.S. Treasuries. Its footprint is growing. Fast.If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today. 1.

Long bond yields in Europe, Japanalso fall back from historic highs. * COMMODITIES: Oil down another 1%. Gold breaks 7-daywinning streak, longest since March 2024.Today\u2019s Talking Points:* Central bank independenceStephen Miran, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for the Fed Board of Governors, testified before a Senate committee on Thursday. Miran said the Fed\u2019s independence is \"paramount\", he will act independently if confirmed, and he is \"not at all\" Trump\u2019s puppet.Trouble is, this may only be lip service. Trump\u2019s efforts to fire Governor Lisa Cook, pressure Chair Jerome Powell and stuff the Board with allies sympathetic to his low interest rate view suggest politicization of the Fed is well underway. So far, markets have only wobbled. But many observers fear they could get a whole lot more volatile.* TarifflationAre tariffs inflationary? So far, the evidence suggests not. Goods price pressures may be heating up, but headline inflation readings aren\u2019t, and inflation expectations aren\u2019t becoming un-moored.\u00a0New York Fed John Williams said on Thursday he sees lower risks to inflation from tariffs than he originally expected, while Trump advisor and Fed nominee Miran said tariffs aren\u2019t inflationary at all. Research by the Yale Budget Lab this week is probably on the money - it\u2019s too early to say, and what\u2019s more, it\u2019s complicated.* Oil (price) spill?Eight OPEC+ members are mulling an additional output hike as the group seeks to regain market share. OPEC+, which pumps about half of the world\u2019s oil, has reversed its strategy of production cuts from April and has already raised quotas by about 2.5 million barrels per day.Further increases should put prices under pressure, a welcome relief for the many governments and central banks trying to get inflation down.Analysts at Goldman Sachs say the market is already oversupplied, and moves like this from OPEC+ could deliver a big enough glut to push Brent down towards $50 a barrel next year. That would imply another 25% downside from here.Gold\u2019s rise in central bank reserves appears unstoppableWorries over inflation, deteriorating U.S. fiscal health, Federal Reserve independence, and geopolitical instability are raising questions about the stability of long-term Treasuries, traditionally the world\u2019s safest asset. In response, many central banks are turning back to that \"barbarous relic\", gold.\u00a0The fortunes of gold and government bonds have diverged sharply this year, a split highlighted this week as the price of bullion struck a new high and many long-dated bond yields hit levels not seen in years or, in some cases, ever.\u00a0U.S. Treasuries haven\u2019t sold off nearly as sharply as European or Japanese bonds, largely because U.S. debt still enjoys solid underlying demand from central banks and other official institutions managing foreign exchange reserves.\u00a0But Treasuries have essentially been \"treading water\" in global reserve portfolios in recent years, while central banks\u2019 gold holdings have mushroomed, thanks to accelerating demand and soaring prices.GOLD STANDARDGold has recently surpassed the euro to become the second-largest global reserve asset after the U.S. dollar and, for the first time since 1996, gold represents a bigger share of central banks\u2019 reserves than Treasuries.\u00a0Central banks now hold 36,000 tons of gold, according to a European Central Bank study, having hoovered up huge volumes since the post-pandemic inflation spike and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. They have increased their holdings by more than 1,000 metric tons in each of the last three years, a record pace and double the average annual purchases in the preceding decade.\u00a0With the price of gold currently above $3,500 an ounce - up a whopping 35% so far this year - central banks\u2019 gold holdings are now worth around $4.5 trillion. That\u2019s significantly more than their $3.5 trillion stash of Treasuries.\u00a0Moreover, Treasuries\u2019 share of total reserves has been shrinking in recent years. It is now only 23%, by some measures, down from previous peaks of more than 30% in the 2010s, and below gold\u2019s current 27% share.\u00a0CHANGED DAYSThe last time gold accounted for a greater share of global reserves than Treasuries was 1996. That date is significant. Many European countries sold gold aggressively in the late 1990s ahead of the launch of the euro. Surprisingly, the biggest seller was Britain, which wasn\u2019t even joining the single currency union.\u00a0Gold slumped to around $250 an ounce in August 1999, down 40% from early 1996. This prompted central banks to adopt the \"Washington Agreement\" that September to effectively cap their sales.\u00a0In broad terms, the late 1990s was not a gold-friendly time. It was a period of solid growth, low and stable inflation, subdued macro volatility, and the rarest of rare occurrences \u2013 a U.S. budget surplus.\u00a0Nearly three decades on, the global macro environment is very different, one far more conducive to gold. Treasuries, in relative terms, are struggling.\u00a0Tavi Costa, macro strategist at Crescat Capital, says there are clear parallels between what we\u2019re seeing today and the 1970s when monetary instability, inflation, and geopolitical shifts made gold a key strategic reserve asset for central banks.The fact that foreign central banks now hold more gold than U.S. Treasuries is a \"significant milestone\" that signals a deeper, longer-term, structural change in reserve management, Costa argues. \"What we are witnessing may well represent the early stages of a major realignment in global reserve composition.\"Could gold recapture the eye-watering 75% share of central banks\u2019 reserve assets it held in the late 1970s and early 1980s? That\u2019s unlikely and would probably require a prolonged economic crisis and years of double-digit inflation.\u00a0But what will stop the yellow metal\u2019s footprint from expanding? That would probably require inflation pressures, geopolitical risk and economic uncertainty to cool significantly. From where we sit now, none of that seems likely in the near term, meaning reserve managers will continue to load up on gold.You wouldn\u2019t bet against it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What could move markets tomorrow? * Japan household spending (July) * UK retail sales (July) * Germany manufacturing (July) * Euro zone GDP (Q2, revised) * Canada PMIs (August) * Canada employment (August) * U.S. nonfarm payrolls (August)Want to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

A close above that level could trigger an acceleration toward $68.70\u2014just below the major top at $69.69.Support remains layered, with $64.05 now acting as the first technical floor. A failure to hold this level would expose prices to a pullback toward the 200-day moving average at $63.28. A deeper breakdown could ultimately retest the primary bottom at $61.12.At 11:04 GMT, Light Crude Oil Futures are trading $65.92, up $1.91 or +2.98%.Oil\u2019s upward momentum is being reinforced by growing disruptions to Russian supply. Ukrainian drone strikes have taken out at least 17% of Russia\u2019s refining capacity\u2014roughly 1.1 million barrels per day\u2014according to Reuters. President Zelenskyy\u2019s vow for \u201cdeep strikes\u201d suggests the threat to infrastructure is ongoing.Meanwhile, diplomatic tensions are adding further pressure. The U.S. has tightened tariffs on Indian imports, attributing the move to India\u2019s continued Russian crude purchases, prompting criticism from New Delhi. Though Washington has so far avoided sanctioning China\u2014Russia\u2019s top oil buyer\u2014geopolitical risks are now firmly embedded in oil price projections.Traders are also focused on the upcoming September 7 OPEC+ meeting, where eight core members\u2014including Saudi Arabia and Russia\u2014will assess output strategy. While the group recently accelerated the rollback of a 2.2 million bpd cut, analysts at ING expect no major policy shift in October. The prevailing view is that supply will remain tight, and the larger risk lies in potential reinstatement of deeper cuts if the market softens.SEB Commodities, however, warned in a client note that prices could average as low as $55 in Q4 unless OPEC+ intervenes again. Such bearish estimates are currently being counterbalanced by physical disruptions and geopolitical tensions.On the demand side, attention is turning to U.S. labor data due later this week, which could influence the Fed\u2019s next rate decision. A weaker jobs report would bolster expectations for monetary easing at the September 16\u201317 meeting. A rate cut would likely pressure the dollar and support demand for dollar-denominated commodities like crude.With technical breakouts aligning with tightening physical supply and potential Fed easing, the near-term outlook for oil remains bullish. If WTI clears $66.18, traders should prepare for a fast move toward $68.70, with supply risks and macro policy shifts offering a supportive backdrop. However, any failure to hold above the 50-day average could reverse momentum sharply.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.

Holding above $3.04 keeps the short-term outlook constructive, while a close under $2.96 could weaken the trend.

Traders remain focused on OPEC+ deliberations over potentially unwinding 1.65 million barrels per day of production cuts, equal to about 1.6% of global demand, a move that could weigh further on prices.U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 0.6 million barrels against forecasts for a 3.4 million-barrel draw, underscoring signs of softer demand.At the same time, natural gas prices have held firmer as geopolitical tensions heighten risk premiums, leaving energy markets caught between oversupply concerns and uncertain demand conditions.Natural gas futures are holding firm above $3.09 after a steady rebound from late August lows. Price action is supported by an ascending trendline and the 50-EMA at $2.99, while the 200-EMA at $2.96 has now turned into a strong base. Momentum remains positive, with RSI near 66, suggesting buyers are in control but approaching overbought levels.Immediate resistance is seen at $3.13, followed by $3.22 and $3.29. A break above these levels could extend the rally further. On the downside, $3.03 is the first support, with the trendline and $2.96 providing deeper backing.Overall, natural gas maintains a bullish bias, but traders may want to watch for a pullback before fresh upside continuation.WTI crude oil broke below its ascending trendline and the 50-EMA near $64.30, shifting momentum to the downside. Price is now holding around $63.20, close to the $63.00 support area. The 200-EMA at $64.18, which acted as a cap earlier, reinforces bearish pressure.RSI sits near 30, showing oversold conditions but without a strong reversal signal yet. If $63.00 fails, the next support rests at $62.10, followed by $61.46. On the upside, recovery above $63.70 could bring a retest of $64.70, but the broader bias remains weak unless buyers reclaim both EMAs.In short, bears remain in control, but oversold momentum suggests a possible short-term bounce before the next decisive move.Brent crude slipped below its rising channel support, now trading near $66.80. Both the 50-EMA ($67.86) and 200-EMA ($67.58) sit above price, confirming downside pressure after last week\u2019s rejection at $69.27. The RSI has dropped to 31, close to oversold territory, suggesting momentum is stretched but not yet reversing.Key support rests at $66.36, followed by $65.63 and $65.00.

These declines mark the first weekly drop in three weeks, driven by renewed supply pressure and a surprise 2.4 million barrel build in U.S. crude inventories, which defied analyst expectations for a draw.The unexpected rise in U.S. crude stocks is adding to near-term demand concerns, especially as refining margins come under pressure. According to BMI analysts, although downstream strength has provided recent support, global demand growth is starting to wane, and upcoming refinery maintenance could dent throughput, weakening buying interest.John Evans of PVM highlighted the growing belief that feedstock supply is no longer a constraint, further dampening bullish enthusiasm. However, geopolitical risks remain a wildcard, with reports that the U.S. is pressuring Europe to halt Russian oil purchases\u2014an action that could restrict supply and offer price support.With WTI futures straddling the 200-day moving average and signs pointing to increased supply, the near-term outlook for crude oil is bearish. Unless OPEC+ delivers a surprise production freeze or curbs, traders should prepare for further downside pressure, particularly if WTI closes below the key support zone.More Information in our Economic Calendar.James Hyerczyk is a U.S. based seasoned technical analyst and educator with over 40 years of experience in market analysis and trading, specializing in chart patterns and price movement.
