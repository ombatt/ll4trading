                **Body:** Trying to size up ConocoPhillips can feel like standing at the crossroads of opportunity and uncertainty. Whether you are debating a new buy, holding steady, or even considering trimming your stake, the stock’s latest action has likely caught your attention. After a choppy start to the year, ConocoPhillips closed at $98.97 recently and has put together a modest 2.3% gain over the last week, alongside a 6.7% lift in the past month. The broader outlook is more nuanced, with shares slipping 1.1% year to date and down 10.2% over the last year, yet up an impressive 231.4% across five years. Some of these moves can be traced to shifting oil prices and new optimism over global demand, as markets keep recalibrating their expectations for energy producers like ConocoPhillips.Valuation matters, and ConocoPhillips currently earns a value score of 4 out of 6, which indicates it is undervalued in four different assessment checks. But what does that really mean for your portfolio? Here is a closer look at each of the major ways stocks like this are valued, followed by a consideration of whether there might be an even smarter approach waiting at the end.Why ConocoPhillips is lagging behind its peersThe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today’s dollar value. This approach aims to gauge what the business is truly worth on a standalone basis, regardless of temporary market ups and downs.For ConocoPhillips, the current Free Cash Flow sits at $8.64 Billion. Analysts forecast the company’s annual cash flows to grow, with projections reaching $9.98 Billion by 2029. Looking further ahead, extended estimates suggest that by 2035, ConocoPhillips could be generating over $12.75 Billion a year in free cash. These projections are based on both analyst estimates for the next five years as well as automated extrapolations beyond that. All of these figures feed into the company’s DCF valuation.Taking these numbers into account, the DCF model calculates ConocoPhillips’ intrinsic value at $193.21 per share. With the stock trading at $98.97, this model suggests the shares are trading at a 48.8% discount to their underlying value.Result: UNDERVALUEDHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for ConocoPhillips.Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests ConocoPhillips is undervalued by 48.8%.

                **Title:** How Recent Oil Price Swings Could Affect Cenovus Energy Shares in 2025
                **Date:** 2025-08-31T10:07:56.000Z
                **Source:** finance.yahoo
                **Body:** If you are trying to decide what to do with Cenovus Energy stock, you are definitely not alone. While this Canadian energy giant traded at $22.84 at the last close, the real question is whether those shares are actually a bargain or not. The stock has experienced its share of ups and downs recently, rising 0.7% in the last week and 11.8% over the past month. Long-term investors who have held Cenovus for the past five years are up 317.0%. However, those who started investing just one year ago may feel less enthusiastic, as the stock is down 5.2% over that period. Part of this volatility appears tied to shifting market perceptions around oil prices and the broader energy sector, with investors reacting to global supply changes and hints of future demand. There is a sense that the risk profile for Canadian energy players like Cenovus is evolving, contributing to some of these rapid moves both up and down. Is Cenovus actually undervalued? After running the company through six key valuation checks, it receives a value score of 3. This means it appears undervalued in three out of six major categories, which may be considered a solid result for bargain hunters, though not definitive. To better understand what this score means for your Cenovus holding, it is helpful to look more closely at these valuation methods, examine what they indicate about the stock today, and consider a more comprehensive approach to valuation that goes beyond the numbers. Why Cenovus Energy is lagging behind its peersA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model attempts to estimate a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting those figures back to their value in today's terms. This helps investors determine what a company may truly be worth, beyond the day-to-day movement in its share price.For Cenovus Energy, the most recent reported Free Cash Flow is CA$3.77 billion. Analysts project steady FCF growth over time, with forecasts reaching CA$5.82 billion by 2028. Looking further out, extrapolated estimates suggest FCF could surpass CA$12.15 billion by 2035. These longer-term projections rely on a blend of analyst insights and calculated growth rates provided by financial platforms, including Simply Wall St.Based on the DCF model used, the estimated intrinsic value for Cenovus shares is CA$134.07. With the stock currently trading at CA$22.84, this implies a substantial 83.0% discount to fair value. Such a gap suggests the stock appears heavily undervalued according to this valuation approach.

                **Title:** Oil rig parts maker to close 80pc of UK arm over Labour ‘cult of carbon’
                **Date:** 2025-08-31T07:00:00.000Z
                **Source:** finance.yahoo
                **Body:** Labour’s “cult of carbon” has forced one of Britain’s oldest oil companies to shed dozens of staff and shut down 80pc of its UK operations, according to its chief executive.Jim Johnson, the chief executive of 150-year-old oil and gas group Hunting, said he was being forced to close four of the company’s five UK centres including its main Scottish site because the Government had destroyed the North Sea offshore oil industry.He said the closures were directly linked to government windfall taxes and over-zealous regulations imposed on the industry to reach net zero.“Carbon reduction has become a religion for the UK – but even if Britain cuts its emissions to zero, it won’t make any difference to global CO2 levels,” he said.“Your politicians have sacrificed Britain’s future to the cult of carbon and it’s set to become a poorer, weaker country.”Hunting, one of the London Stock Exchange’s oldest listed companies, uses advanced engineering to make high pressure pipes for subsea oil and gas wells as well as for warplanes and spacecraft. It is best known for building the fuselages and trail frames for Britain’s Lancaster Bomber to help win the Second World War.Mr Johnson, an American, said swingeing tax raids on the oil and gas sector by successive UK governments over the past four years had crippled the North Sea.“Both your main parties [Labour and Conservative] have been hugely negligent for the UK’s future energy supplies. They have made some utterly ridiculous decisions,” he said.“Aberdeen was a global centre for oil and gas but it is being flushed down the toilet. I went to Norway recently – they have the same geology as the UK – and the attitude was ‘drill, baby, drill’, because there’s still lots of oil out there.”Hunting’s main loss will be its Fordoun facility in Scotland, which will be consolidated into its Badentoy site in Portlethen, near Aberdeen, with the loss of 40 jobs.Mr Johnson’s comments are directed partly at the previous Conservative government – which imposed an oil windfall tax in 2022 – but his main criticisms are aimed at Labour which raised total taxes to 78pc, cut some tax breaks and put a ban on drilling for new oil and gas.Like many other oil and gas companies, he is concerned about rapid changes in fiscal and regulatory policy. Such uncertainty makes it harder to raise money for investment and typically leads to higher borrowing rates, he said.

                **Body:** Investing.com - Goldman Sachs expects both Norwegian krone (NOK) and Swedish krona (SEK) to strengthen against the U.S. dollar in coming months, with a slight preference for SEK, according to a recent research note.The investment bank views the current market environment as supportive for Scandinavian currencies, citing ongoing dollar hedging programs and global reallocations away from U.S. assets as beneficial trends. Goldman Sachs also anticipates both EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK exchange rates to gradually decline toward the firm’s three-month targets.The bank’s outlook is tempered by potential risks, noting that both currencies, particularly NOK, could underperform significantly during periods of reduced risk appetite or continued U.S. economic slowdown. For the Norwegian krone, these cyclical risks are further complicated by Goldman’s bearish outlook on oil prices in the coming months.Goldman Sachs identifies the Norwegian general election on September 8 as a key risk event for NOK. The firm highlights that the most significant currency impact could come from the success of parties advocating for looser restrictions on channeling foreign currency revenues from Norway’s sovereign wealth fund back into NOK and the domestic economy.The Progress Party in Norway has been campaigning on this platform, which could create upside potential for the currency if successful. However, Goldman considers significant wealth fund reform a low-probability outcome, citing historical resistance to changing the fund’s mandate and current polling that suggests no single party is likely to achieve a majority.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

                **Title:** California sets aside penalties for high refinery profits
                **Date:** 2025-08-30T00:24:27+00:00

                **Body:** By Erwin SebaHOUSTON (Reuters) -California’s Energy Commission voted on Friday to temporarily set aside penalties for excessive refining profits that were adopted after gasoline pump prices climbed over $8 a gallon in 2022. The five-year delay in implementing the penalties comes as Phillips 66’s Los Angeles refinery is preparing to begin shutting production as early as next week ahead of a permanent closure. "The fact is, supply is declining faster than demand, and we need to bring them into alignment: that means slowing supply loss while aggressively pursuing the transition to zero emission vehicles," the Commission’s staff said in an emailed statement.California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom had proposed the penalties, but has since switched direction amid worries of price spikes in 2026 after the closure of the Phillips 66 refinery and a San Francisco-area plant operated by Valero Energy Corp next year. Both companies said declining gasoline demand promoted by state’s policies in favor of non-fossil-fuel-powered vehicles made the once-lucrative California market untenable in the long-term. California has adopted a goal to ban the sale of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles by 2035.The delay was supported by Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), which had called for the penalties to be delayed for 20 years, saying prices were determined by global oil markets and not the state’s policies. The state’s Consumer Watchdog group faulted the change in direction by California officials."By taking the penalty off the table, you are opening the market to the price spikes we suffered in 2022," said Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court in a letter prior to the vote. In addition to putting penalties on hold, the commission also voted to adopt policies to stabilize California’s refinery capacity, increase motor fuel imports and promote development of the state’s oil reserves. California is isolated by the Rocky Mountains from the U.S. refining centers along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Midwest. The state relies on what plants in that state and Washington can make as well as imports from Asian refineries. The fastest way to find out is with our Fair Value calculator.

                **Body:** By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK (Reuters) -Major stock indexes fell on Friday, with technology shares including Dell Technologies leading declines, while the dollar weakened against the euro after U.S. inflation data kept alive expectations of a September interest rate cut.Dell dropped 8.9% after it reported results late Thursday that included high manufacturing costs for artificial intelligence-optimized servers. Other AI-related shares fell in the broader tech selloff including Nvidia, down 3.3%, and Broadcom, down 3.6%. The Nasdaq fell more than 1% and the S&P 500 technology index fell 1.6%.The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday its Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) rose 0.2% in July, versus an unrevised 0.3% increase in June and matching the estimate of economists polled by Reuters.In the 12 months through July, PCE inflation increased 2.6% after climbing 2.6% in June. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PCE Price Index increased 0.3% last month. That followed a 0.3% rise in core inflation in June."You have to love it when a plan comes together. Today’s numbers on both the personal consumption, expenditure, and income, and spending, were right down the middle of the fairway," Art Hogan, chief markets strategist for B. Riley Wealth in Boston, said via email."This leaves the door wide open for the Fed to cut rates in September and likely again in October and in December."Traders are now pricing in 89% odds of a cut by the Federal Reserve next month, up from 84% before the data. Traders had increased bets on more cuts after Fed Chair Jerome Powell last Friday adopted an unexpectedly dovish tone.The euro was last up 0.11% at $1.1696. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.09% to 97.79.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 92.02 points, or 0.20%, to 45,544.88, the S&P 500 fell 41.60 points, or 0.64%, to 6,460.26 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 249.61 points, or 1.15%, to 21,455.55."Today is just weakness in the top of the market, in tech," said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. For the month, the S&P 500 rose 1.9%, the Dow rose 3.2% and the Nasdaq added 1.6%.Major U.S. financial markets will be closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday.European shares closed lower, hitting their lowest in over two weeks, weighed down by British banks.

It has fallen 33 basis points this month, the most in a year.Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday said he wanted to start cutting interest rates next month and "fully expects" more rate cuts to follow, to bring the Fed’s policy rate closer to a neutral setting.Investors are keen to see U.S. jobs data for August, which is due next Friday.They also are watching for more news on U.S. President Donald Trump’s attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.A federal judge said on Friday she would set an expedited briefing schedule in Cook’s bid to temporarily block Trump from firing her while she pursues a lawsuit that says he has no valid reason to remove her.Oil prices were lower.

                **Body:** By Erwin SebaHOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil prices fell on Friday as traders looked toward weaker demand in the U.S., the world’s largest oil market, and a boost in supply this autumn from OPEC and its allies.Brent crude futures for October delivery, which expired on Friday, settled at $68.12 a barrel, down 50 cents, or 0.73%. The more active contract for November finished down 53 cents, or 0.78%, at $67.45.West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled at $64.01, down 59 cents, or 0.91%.The market was in part shifting its focus toward next week’s OPEC+ meeting, said Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates.Crude output has increased from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, as the group has accelerated output hikes to regain market share, raising the supply outlook and weighing on global oil prices."Overall, the bottom line is we’re going to see a jump in supply feeding into a lackluster demand market," said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.The U.S. summer driving season ends on Monday’s Labor Day holiday, signalling the end of the highest demand period in the United States, which is the largest fuel market."The market is beginning to wonder what effect the tariffs might have on the economic outlook next year," Lipow said, referring to tariffs imposed by the administration of President Donald Trump on U.S. imports from many trading partners.Crude supply increases have not made their way into the U.S. market yet, raising the possibility supply and demand will be in a tighter balance, said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group."The pessimism about demand, I’m just not seeing it," Flynn said. "Supply from OPEC is supposed to increase, but we’re not seeing it in the U.S. I think things are going to stay tight."Prices rose earlier in the week due to Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil export terminals, but reports of talks between Ukraine’s European allies about a possible ceasefire helped tamp down prices, Flynn said.U.S. crude inventories for the week ending August 22 showed higher-than-expected draws, implying late-summer demand was still firm, particularly in industrial and freight-related sectors, analyst Ole Hvalbye at SEB bank said in a note. [EIA/S]Investors are also watching for India’s response to pressure from the United States to stop buying Russian oil, after Trump doubled tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50% on Wednesday.So far, India has defied the U.S. and Russian oil exports to India are set to rise in September, traders said."The prevalent view is that Russian sanctions are not forthcoming, and India will ignore U.S. sanction threats and continue buying Russian crude oil at heavily discounted prices," PVM’s Varga said.The best opportunities often hide in plain sight—buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

                **Body:** Investing.com - Canada’s main stock exchange bounded higher Friday, as investors focused on growth data as well as important U.S. inflation numbers. At 1:05 ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was higher by 149.5 points or 0.5%, having closed Thursday at a record high. The S&P/TSX 60 rose by 9.7 points or 0.6%, after closing slightly lower in the previous session.Canadian stocks have climbed to record highs this week, boosted by solid earnings from the country’s main banks.Attention is now on economic data, with Canada’s gross domestic product report showed a steeper-than-expected annualized decline in GDP of 1.6%, missing expectations of a 0.7% decline significantly.The decline marked the first quarterly contraction in real GDP since Q4 2022 and was mirrored by three consecutive monthly GDP decreases through June, also a first since late 2022. CIBC economist Andrew Grantham believes the data adds pressure on the Bank of Canada to cut rates starting in September, saying, "The main news in today’s release is actually how weak momentum still was towards the end of the quarter and into the start of Q3, even as exports had begun to stabilize. We continue to think that a couple more interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada are needed to accelerate the recovery."In the U.S., the spotlight was on the release of the U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge as they seek more clarity on the path for interest rates for the rest of the year.Data released Friday showed that the core PCE price index rose 0.3% on a monthly basis, putting the annual rate at 2.9%, its highest level in five months.This was in line with expectations, suggesting that U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs were not filtering excessively into consumer prices, despite a recent upside surprise in producer inflation.Oil prices slipped lower, but are set for a weekly gain, as traders weigh uncertainty over Russian supply as well as the proximity to the end of the important U.S. summer driving season.At 1:20 ET, Brent futures slipped 0.8% to $67.44 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.8% to $64.13 a barrel.Both contracts are on course for weekly gains of just under 1%, with the lack of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raising doubts about the peace process.On a broader scale, both contracts are set for monthly losses of over 6%, dragged by steady production hikes by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Gold prices jumped on Friday, adding to strong gains in August amid increasing bets on a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.Spot gold rose 1% to $3,449.32 an ounce, while gold futures for October gained 1.2% to $3,517.00/oz, as of 1:20 ET.Spot gold was trading up 3.7% in August, and was now less than $100 away from its April record high.

                **Body:** Investing.com - European stocks fell Friday, as investors digested consumer price increases from some of the region’s biggest economies ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. The DAX index in Germany dropped 0.5%, the CAC 40 in France slipped 0.8% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. fell 0.3%. European, U.S. inflation in spotlight Data released earlier Friday showed that French consumer prices rose slightly less than anticipated in August, with the country’s harmonised inflation rate coming in at +0.8% year-on-year in August, down from a +0.9% rise in July.Spain’s European Union-harmonised 12-month inflation rate remained at 2.7% in August, from the period through July, and the equivalent German data is scheduled for later in the session, ahead of the flash August reading for the euro area next Tuesday.The European Central Bank left its key rate at 2% at its July meeting, and data since then has confirmed the eurozone economy was holding up while inflation hovered at the ECB’s 2% target.ECB policymakers are widely expected to hold rates unchanged again in September, but the minutes from the July meeting showed that they were divided on whether inflation was more likely to come in higher or lower moving forward.The U.S. personal consumption expenditures report, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, took center stage later in the day. Data showed that the core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose 0.3% on a monthly basis, putting the annual rate at 2.9%, its highest level in five months. In the European corporate sector,  Remy Cointreau  (EPA:RCOP) raised the lower end of its annual guidance after the United States and European Union agreed to cut planned tariffs on European wines and spirits in half, easing pressure on the French cognac maker’s earnings.The revised trade agreement, effective August 1, set tariffs at 15%, down from the initially proposed 30%. Norwegian construction company Af Gruppen (OL:AFGA) reported a sharp rise in profit for the second quarter of 2025, and Swedish property company Sagax (ST:SAGAa) acquired a 10.8% stake in Belgium-based Retail Estates (EBR:RETE).Oil prices slipped lower, but are set for a weekly gain, as traders weigh uncertainty over Russian supply as well as the proximity to the end of the important U.S. summer driving season.At 11:55 ET, Brent futures slipped 0.4% to $67.69 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.5% to $64.28 a barrel.Both contracts are on course for weekly gains of just under 1%, with prices gaining after Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil export terminals raised doubts about Russian supply, while the lack of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised doubts about the peace process.However, the end of the U.S. summer driving demand period with the Labor Day holiday on Monday have weighed on prices.On a broader scale, both contracts are set for monthly losses of over 6%, dragged by steady production hikes by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.ProPicks AI evaluates RCOP alongside thousands of other companies every month using 100+ financial metrics.

                **Title:** Oil prices slip marginally lower; Ukraine peace deal, India tariffs in focus
                **Date:** 2025-08-29T13:02:52+00:00

                **Body:** Investing.com-- Oil prices slipped marginally lower Friday after rallying the previous session, as markets grappled with dimming prospects of a Russia-Ukraine peace deal and evaluated the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on India.At 09:00 ET (13:00 GMT), Brent Oil Futures expiring in October dropped 0.2% to $67.82 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate WTI crude futures declined 0.2% to $64.50 per barrel.Oil prices settled nearly 1% higher on Thursday, shrugging off early losses as U.S. data showed a smaller-than-expected decline in crude stockpiles.However, both contracts are set for monthly losses of over 6%, dragged by steady production hikes by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).Peace hopes have dimmed after U.S. President Donald Trump last week urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks before considering a trilateral summit hosted by Washington. While Trump offered U.S. security guarantees short of troop deployment, no date or venue for a meeting has been set, and analysts see little progress in the near term.Meanwhile, Russia carried out a fresh wave of deadly attacks on Kyiv, damaging buildings housing the EU mission and the British Council.“The lack of progress towards a peace deal means risks of sanctions and secondary tariffs continue to hang over the oil market,” ING analysts said in a note.In a move tied to India’s aggression in buying Russian crude, an additional 25% U.S. tariff on Indian imports took effect on Wednesday, doubling the total duty to 50% starting August 27. This step is part of broader pressure aimed at curbing India’s ties with Russia amid the Ukraine war.Indian refiners boosted U.S. crude oil purchases this month, drawn by competitive prices, Reuters reported, a move that could help narrow the country’s trade deficit with the United States amid tensions between the two nations.The country’s top refiner, Indian Oil Corp, has bought 5 million barrels of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in October and November via a tender, trade sources said.This came after another state refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp purchased 2 million barrels of U.S. WTI crude while private refiner Reliance Industries has bought 2 million barrels of WTI crude from Vitol, other sources said.Indian refiners, along with others in Asia, stepped up purchases after the arbitrage window for U.S. crude to Asia opened. India is also under pressure to buy more U.S. oil after the United States doubled its tariffs on Indian imports to 50%, citing New Delhi’s buying of Russian oil.The market will be cautiously watching Russian oil flows to India closely going forward to gauge the impact.Aysuhman Ojha contributed to this articleAsk WarrenAI, our powerful AI financial research assistant.

                **Title:** Oil faces uphill struggle as supply glut worries mount: Reuters poll

                **Body:** By Brijesh Patel(Reuters) -Oil prices are unlikely to gain much traction from current levels this year as rising output from top producers adds to the risk of a surplus and U.S. tariff threats curb demand growth, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.A survey of 31 economists and analysts conducted in August forecasts Brent crude will average $67.65 per barrel in 2025, little changed from July’s $67.84 forecast. The global benchmark has averaged around $70 so far this year.U.S. crude is seen at $64.65, compared with last month’s $64.61 estimate."(With) the latest OPEC+ supply increases and the expected lackluster global demand, the prospect is for an even larger market surplus in 2025," said Moutaz Altaghlibi, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO.He said the outlook remains clouded by "deep uncertainty" concerning any additional U.S. tariffs, especially those associated with geopolitical outcomes such as an Iranian nuclear deal or Russia agreeing to a ceasefire.Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together known as OPEC+, agreed to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September."OPEC+ probably still has not reached the end of their output hikes. At the moment, market share seems to be more important than a higher level of oil prices," said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW."This will lead to a big supply surplus on oil markets in 2025 and 2026 and will keep prices down."Washington’s attempts to broker peace in Ukraine with Moscow have so far proven unsuccessful. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed additional tariffs on India, pressuring New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil.Most of the poll respondents see limited impact on the oil market from Trump’s threats on Russian crude buyers, as they expect OPEC+ and alternative suppliers could mitigate supply gaps.However, the geopolitical risk premium is expected to underpin oil prices as a quick Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal seems highly unlikely, analysts said.Global oil demand is seen growing by between 500,000 and 1.1 million bpd in 2025, the poll showed, compared to the International Energy Agency forecast of 680,000 bpd.Meanwhile, OPEC raised its global oil demand forecast for next year and trimmed its estimate for growth in supply from the U.S. and other producers outside the wider OPEC+ group."U.S. production is an interesting one as President Trump would like to push for more production, but OPEC+ may be right in their projections. The reason around this is price," said Zain Vawda, analyst at MarketPulse by OANDA.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

                **Body:** October WTI crude oil (CLV25) on Friday closed down -0.59 (-0.91%), and October RBOB gasoline (RBV25) closed down -0.0213 (-1.07%).Crude oil and gasoline prices moved lower on Friday as a slide in stocks prompted a risk-off sentiment in asset markets.  Also, Friday's weaker-than-expected global economic news was bearish for energy demand and crude prices.  Losses in crude were limited on speculation that Europe and its allies will ramp up sanctions on Russia for not seeking to end the war in Ukraine.  Friday's global economic news was mainly weaker-than-expected, a negative factor for energy demand and crude prices.   The University of Michigan US Aug consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.4 to 58.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 58.6.  Also, the US Aug MNI Chicago PMI fell -5.6 to 41.5, weaker than expectations of 46.0.  In addition, German Jul retail sales fell -1.5% m/m, weaker than expectations of no change and the biggest decline in almost two years.  Finally, Japan's Jul industrial production fell -1.6% m/m, weaker than expectations of -1.1% m/m and the largest decline in 8 months.Crude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies.  On Friday, German Chancellor Merz and French President Macron called for secondary sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine.  They said they will push for measures targeting "companies from third countries that support Russia's war."  President Trump also threatened "very big consequences" if Russia doesn't come to the negotiating table.  On Thursday, German Chancellor Merz stated that a meeting between Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky was unlikely to occur.An increase in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bearish for oil prices.  Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days rose by +11% w/w to 96.77 million bbl in the week ended August 22.Concerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices after OPEC+ on August 2 endorsed an additional 547,000 bpd increase in its crude production for September 1.  OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026.  OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026.  OPEC+ will meet again on September 7.  OPEC July crude production fell by -20,000 bpd to 28.31 million bpd.Wednesday's weekly EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of August 22 were -5.2% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.3% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -14.8% below the 5-year seasonal average.  US crude oil production in the week ending August 22 rose by +0.4% w/w to 13.439 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12/6/2024.Baker Hughes reported Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending August 29 rose by +1 to 412 rigs, just above the 3.75-year low of 410 rigs from August 1.  Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.25-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.

                **Body:** Crude oil rallied yesterday as the Russia-Ukraine situation continued to escalate. German leadership confirmed late yesterday that Zelensky and Putin would not meet, leaving a peace deal basically dead in the water. EU leadership is also considering secondary sanctions for buyers of Russian oil, similar to those imposed by the US on India. These secondary sanctions, if enacted by both the EU and the US, can together target Beijing, where an estimated 80% of Russian sanctions evasion is occurring. Catalysts are stacking up bullish in Crude oil. Journalists and bank analysts will continue to point to the forward balance sheets to push bearish positions, as they have for the past two years. This morning, the macro environment is trading risk-off with equities lower alongside precious metals and crude oil. The Dollar is showing some outsized strength. Technical Analysis: Crude oil futures rallied late day after showing surprising weakness in the morning. Fundamental catalysts are stacking bullish, and signs of hair-trigger buying yesterday helped our confidence in the bull case. We favor owning upside risk in crude over the weekend due to the Ukraine-Russia peace catalyst unraveling entirely. Subscribe to our daily Energy Update for essential insights into Crude Oil and more.

                **Body:** WTI Crude Oil futures posted a solid rally yesterday, regaining about half of Tuesday’s move lower. The bullish price action can be attributed to technical support, a bullish EIA Yesterday’s EIA report tilted bullish. The EIA figures were as follows [thousand barrels]:Crude Oil: -2,392 vs -2,000 estimateGasoline: -1,236 vs -1,600 estimateDistillate: -1,786 vs +500 estimateRefinery Utilization:-2.00% vs -0.40% estimateDraws across all three categories gave the report a bullish tilt while Diesel demand continued to outperform. Overnight, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict heated up with Ukraine striking a major Russian refinery and Russia striking Ukraine. As we talked about last week after the peace summits, the West’s plans for security guarantees and troops in Ukraine would be a non-starter for Putin. With the India pressure still in the works, the EU is now considering similar secondary sanctions on third-party buyers of Russian oil. Catalysts are stacking up bullish again. Technical Analysis: Our key yesterday was a settlement and scaled buying above 63.40***. With that coming to fruition, our lean is increasingly bullish. Fundamentals and technicals are starting to support the odds of a run higher in crude. Subscribe to our daily Energy Update for essential insights into Crude Oil and more.
