                **Body:** US stocks edged higher on Wednesday as investors counted down to Nvidia's (NVDA) highly anticipated earnings report, seen as a pivotal test for the tech-driven summer rally.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose almost 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed more than 0.2% to notch a record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.2%.The move higher came on the heels of small gains for stocks on Wall Street on Tuesday.The waiting game is on for Nvidia's quarterly results, slated to arrive after the bell. Investor hopes for the world's most valuable company are sky-high, with the AI chip giant expected to post record-high revenue and adjusted profit for the second quarter.But investors are watching for the fallout from President Trump's curbs on China chip sales, which Nvidia forecast will deliver an $8 billion hit to its quarterly bottom line. More widely, the Big Tech bellwether's earnings are a big test for the broader AI trade that has driven the bull market in stocks. Traders are pricing in a swing of roughly 6% — or about $260 billion — in Nvidia shares after its report, options showed.Read more: Live coverage of corporate earningsWhile stock markets largely shrugged off Trump's move to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook on allegations of mortgage fraud, some small signs of stress are showing in bonds. Two-year Treasury yields were up just two points after sliding to 3.65% — their lowest since May — even as 30-year yields (^TYX) stay atop 4.9%.On the trade front, the European Union is looking to fast-track the removal of tariffs on all US industrial goods, Bloomberg reported, clearing the way for an easing of duties on EU auto imports in return. Meanwhile, Trump's hefty 50% tariffs on Indian products kicked in on Wednesday, in reprisal for India's purchases of Russian oil. Crude prices oil (CL=F, BZ=F) edged higher after a 2% slide the prior session.Meanwhile, Cracker Barrel (CBRL) stock continued to rise after the company bowed to calls from Trump and the public that it should never have scrapped its old logo.Nvidia (NVDA) stock slid more than 2% in after-hours trading after the company beat on earnings but missed on data center revenue for its second quarter, revenue forecast omits H20 shipments to China.The AI giant posted adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share versus expectations of $1.01.Data center revenue was $41.1 billion, slightly below Wall Street consensus estimates of $41.23 billion, according to Bloomberg data.Additionally, the company's revenue forecast for the third quarter of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, does not assume any H20 shipments to China. The omission underscores the uncertainty hanging over US chipmakers amid Washington's trade tensions with Beijing.The US has allowed Nvidia to send China its H20 chips, which are less powerful next-generation Blackwell technology, in exchange for a cut of the company's revenue. However, China's government has advised domestic companies to use alternative chipmakers.Nvidia stock has rallied roughly 35% year to date to lead the AI tech trade.Going into Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings after the bell, Wall Street will be closely watching the chipmaker’s performance in one of its key markets: China.Nvidia was hit with a surprise export ban on sales of its H20 chips to China in April — a move that was set to cost the chipmaker $8 billion in lost sales in its second quarter. In yet another unexpected move, the Trump administration said in July it would grant Nvidia export licenses for its H20 chips in exchange for 15% of the revenue from those sales — an agreement likely to face legal challenges due to the US Constitution’s ban on export taxes.The reversal of the ban could help Nvidia recoup as much as $15 billion in revenue from China in the second half of the year to hit around $20 billion from the region for its 2026 fiscal year, which ends next January. That would be an uptick from its roughly $17 billion in sales from China in 2025.But analysts have moderated their optimism over any uplift from Nvidia’s sales to China headed into Wednesday’s report, with Stifel analyst Ruben Roy noting their could be “near-term speed bumps” related to Nvidia’s position in that market.That’s because Nvidia has reportedly asked its suppliers to halt production of components for its H20 chips. The news came after conflicting reports over whether China is ordering companies to stop buying Nvidia’s H20 chips. The Information reported earlier this month that China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, issued a directive to tech companies to suspend their purchases of Nvidia’s chips. But the same day, a Reuters report said authorities were questioning Chinese companies over their orders of H20 chips, not ordering them to stop those purchases.More will be revealed in short order.Nvidia (NVDA) stock was steady with less than one hour of trading before the close as investors awaited the AI chip giant's highly anticipated earnings.Nvidia has been the poster child of the artificial intelligence trade. The stock has rallied roughly 35% year-to-date to lead this year's market rally.Yahoo Finance plans to interview Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at 6:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, following the company's earnings call.Cryptocurrencies were rallying on Wednesday, with ethereum (ETH-USD) continuing to lead the charge, rising more than 2.5%, among the major cryptocurrencies, while bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ripple's XRP (XRP-USD) also rose.Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, has staged a stunning comeback this year, surging more than 200% from April lows compared to a 45% rise in bitcoin during the same period.Ether briefly hit a new all-time high Sunday, topping $4,900, as a dovish speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell late last week lifted broader markets, with crypto continuing this rally into the weekend.Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still down about 10% from its mid-August all-time high north of $124,000.Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is bracing for the impact of higher tariffs, including a 50% US levy on its Indian imports."Our impact between the whole network is just under $200 million," CEO Robert Ford said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (video above). "But I think the key thing here, one thing that we have learned, is once tariffs come into place, whether in the United States or in another country, they do not go away."Ford added the healthcare company is finding ways to mitigate the tariffs, including making long-term investments in manufacturing and supply chains.Read more here. Shares of Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) climbed 6% on Wednesday after the bank reported strong results across all three of its business segments.RBC's diluted earnings per share of $3.75 and revenue of $16.99 billion topped Wall Street estimates.The Canadian Press reports:The bank's personal banking segment reported net income of $1.9 billion, up $352 million or 22 per cent from a year earlier. Its commercial banking division reported a net income of $836 million, up $19 million or two per cent from the same quarter last year.RBC Wealth Management reported a net income of $1.1 billion, up $147 million or 15 per cent from last year. Capital Markets profit was $1.3 billion, up $156 million or 13 per cent from last year.RBC Insurance had a net income of $247 million, up $77 million or 45 per cent from a year ago.Read more here.Thinking about visiting a Cracker Barrel (CBRL) now that you've heard so much about it? You might not be alone, Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma writes.The stock was up more than 8% in afternoon trading on Wednesday.Brooke reports on Wall Street's reaction to the logo reversal:In a client note published Wednesday, Citi's Jon Tower said the "late August hubbub" over the brand could actually benefit the business in the near term."While the lasting impact on the business is unclear, this late August hubbub has drawn attention ... growing attention does not always translate into consistent visits nor solve the brand's longer-term issues around relevancy to younger consumers, but could spark curiosity and visits near-term as consumers determine what all the ballyhoo was all about," he wrote in a note to clients.Tower said that searches for "Cracker Barrel" hit a record high on Google over the past week.Read more here.IonQ (IONQ) shares jumped nearly 3% after B Riley Securities analyst Craig Ellis initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating.Ellis said he believes "quantum computing will increasingly solve problems once considered classically intractable in the next five to 10 year" and that "IONQ could be a leader, likely accruing significant value as its capabilities mature."He noted that IonQ has sold quantum computers since 2021, has brought online 10 quantum computing systems, and was the first quantum computing system available on all three major cloud providers — Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT).IonQ stock has surged 474% over the past 12 months but has had a volatile 2025, up just 0.4% year to date, as skepticism over quantum technologies and mounting losses in its most recent quarter put pressure on shares.UnitedHealth Group shares rose 1% Wednesday, holding steady despite a Bloomberg report that the US Department of Justice's criminal probe into the insurer is wider than previously thought.Bloomberg reported that the DOJ's criminal division is investigating UnitedHealth's prescription management segment, Optum Rx, in addition to potential Medicare fraud. News of the initial investigation was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in May.Shares of UNH are still down 40% for the year amid regulatory scrutiny, a shake-up among top executives, and broader industry pressures.American Eagle (AEO) shares jumped as much as 5% after announcing a collaboration with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, a day after the football player announced his engagement to Taylor Swift.The limited edition collaboration featuring lifestyle and sportswear is called "AE x Tru Kolors by Travis Kelce." Kelce also stars in the ad campaign for the new line.Even with Wednesday's gain, American Eagle stock is down 23% in 2025 as the apparel maker has reported declines in revenue and earnings per share in its last three quarterly earnings reports.Meanwhile, shares of rival Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) traded flat on Wednesday after the company reported earnings that topped expectations but showed a decline in net sales in its Abercrombie brand.US stocks traded mixed at the open of Wednesday's trading session as investors awaited Nvidia's (NVDA) highly anticipated earnings report after the bell.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up nearly 0.1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell below the flat line and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dipped 0.15%.The mixed open comes on the heels of small gains for stocks on Wall Street on Tuesday.Bond yields continued to push higher on Wednesday following President Trump's move to oust Fed governor Lisa Cook, which was marked by a relatively tame market reaction.While short-term yields slipped lower, concerns about eroding Fed independence and tariffs pushed long-run yields higher as fears grew that the pressure on the Fed could lead to inflation running hotter over time.The 10-year yield (^TNX) moved up 3 basis points to 4.28%, while the 30-year yield (^TYX) rose 4 basis points to hold above 4.95%.The Treasury yield curve also steepened to the highest level since April. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yield now stands at 62 basis points.Nvidia (NVDA) stock gained 0.5% in premarket trading ahead of its earnings release after the closing bell on Wednesday. The AI chipmaker will round out Big Tech earnings after a quarter of back-and-forth with the Trump administration.Yahoo Finance's Daniel Howley notes that investors will be on the lookout for continued shipment scaling of Nvidia's GB200 super chip, the ramp of its upcoming Blackwell Ultra chip, AI spending, and commentary on China sales during the company's earnings call on Wednesday.Options traders expect Nvidia's market value to swing about $260 billion after its second quarter earnings, suggesting investors feel more certain about the company's performance.Read Dan's full preview of Nvidia earnings here.Goldman Sachs expects the price of Brent (BZ=F) crude futures contracts to fall to the low $50s a barrel by late 2026, its analysts said in a note to clients.An increase in the oil surplus next year will drive the decline from current levels, Goldman said, amid reduced demand in leading economies.Oil prices steadied after Tuesday's steep drop as traders assessed the start of 50% US tariffs on Indian goods, a reprisal for its imports of Russian crude.Indian government estimates suggest global crude prices could more than triple to around $200 a barrel if the country stops buying oil from Russia, Reuters reported.Kohl's (KSS) raised its full-year profit forecast on Wednesday, in a sign that the department store chain's turnaround push is paying off.Shares surged over 15% in premarket trading as investors welcomed the retailer's earnings report, which eased worries over Kohl's warning on Tuesday that it was seeking more time to pay vendors.Kohl's has downsized its jewelry business among other moves to rein in costs, while it has also stepped up efforts to draw in shoppers during the key holiday season.Reuters reports:Kohl's expects annual earnings per share of 50 cents to 80 cents, compared with its earlier wide range of 10 cents to 60 cents."We were able to expand our gross margins, reduce our inventory, and lower our expenses, leading to solid second-quarter earnings," said interim-CEO Michael Bender.Kohl's second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 56 cents handily beat estimates of 29 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.For the quarter ended August 2, comparable sales fell 4.2%, smaller than estimates of a 5% decline.Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Aug. 22)Earnings: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HP), Kohl's (KSS), Pure Storage (PSTG), Snowflake (SNOW), The J.M.

The 10-year (^TNX) meandered down a hair. And longer-dated US bond prices rose only slightly, even as concerns mounted that Trump's moves against the Federal Reserve's independence could stoke inflation and instability.The reaction was nothing like the post-"Liberation Day" sell-off. Back then, the bond market strong-armed the president into backing away from his most punishing tariff policies.But this time, as the president attempts to fire a Federal Reserve governor, Wall Street appears largely unbothered. What changed?Part of the answer has to do with timing. Right now, in the short term, the interests of the three main players — the Fed, the president, and the market — are all very much aligned.As economists Stephen Brown and Thomas Ryan from Capital Economics put it in a note on Tuesday, "It remains unclear whether Trump’s letter firing Cook, posted on social media [Monday], will have any practical effect on policy setting in the near term." ...But even when markets tolerate a legally dubious but aligned maneuver, what happens in the longer run should the Fed see itself remade as a political entity?Read more here.Shares of MongoDB (MDB) surged over 30% in premarket trading following surprising momentum in the database software provider's subscription revenue.The company posted strong quarterly results on Tuesday, driven by accelerating revenue growth in its Atlas cloud database service and new customer acquisition.In the second quarter, overall revenue rose 24% year over year to $591.4 million. MongoDB reported a loss per share of $0.58. Both metrics surpassed Wall Street's estimates for revenue of $553 million and a loss of $0.85 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence."Many of our recently added customers are building AI applications, underscoring how our value proposition is resonating in the AI era and why MongoDB is emerging as a key component of the AI infrastructure stack," MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria said.Here's a look at some of the top stocks trending in premarket trading:Cracker Barrel (CBRL) stock rose 6% before the bell on Wednesday after the company reverted back to its old logo due to consumer backlash and pressure from President Trump.“We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our ‘old timer’ will remain,” the company said in a statement.Okta (OKTA) stock rose more than 5% premarket after beating earnings estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings and lifting its full-year revenue outlook.Snowflake (SNOW) shares rose 4% before the bell ahead of its earnings release on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting Snowflake's revenue to grow 25.4% year on year to $1.09 billion, slowing from the 28.9% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.27 per share.MongoDB, Inc (MDB) stock soared by 30% before the bell on Wednesday, following the software company's strong earnings release on Tuesday.

                # Global energy market: India tariff impacts, Goldman's oil call
                **Date:** 2025-08-27T18:30:00+00:00

                **Body:** President Trump announced 50% tariffs on imports from India. The levies come in response to India buying Russian oil, despite the ongoing war in Ukraine. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré examines what the tariffs mean for oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) and the global energy market, and how Goldman Sachs's recent Brent crude oil (BZ=F) price projection ties in.To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.Ines, India has benefited for years when it comes to cheap Russian oil. So, given that the US has now doubled those tariffs on India, what are the implications for the global energy market?Yeah, Ali, so as you mentioned, India has been very much benefiting from purchasing Russian oil. Uh China as well. So as the war in Ukraine has continued, China and India have been big buyers of Russian oil, which the EU has placed uh sanctions on as well, uh on oil caps uh for Russian oil. So, you really have or price caps, I should say. You have the situation where President Trump is utilizing energy, oil to negotiate and imposing these secondary tariffs because he's saying if you are purchasing Russian oil, then you are essentially helping fund the war in Ukraine. So this is a way for India to stop buying Russian oil for Russia to have less funds to fund the war in Ukraine and it is also a sort of negotiating tactic that analysts see for India to come to the negotiating table as well. So, one analyst is saying that while India would come to the negotiating table with these 25% additional tariffs that are placed, he's saying that the in the near term, the crude market is sort of shrugging this off. We have seen oil going a bit higher in some of these sessions and that is because some uh oil targets, energy targets, Russian energy targets uh have been hit by uh by Ukraine. So that is why we have seen some of the volatility that we've seen with oil, but if you take a look at uh oil year to date, you are still seeing that oil is down 13% uh for WTI, Brent crude down uh more than 11% and what would really send oil prices lower is of course, if you uh also saw the uh war uh end as well. So, this is right now the market is sort of shrugging off uh these tariffs and doesn't expect the war to end anytime soon.Yeah, and Ines, we're looking at Brent crude trading at just around 66 bucks a barrel, but Goldman Sachs out with a new note this morning saying that it expects the price of Brent to decline to about $50 a barrel. That's by late 2026. So what's behind the call there?Yeah, so what they're saying is is that this is all being driven by oil surplus, that you are going to have much more oil in the market than needed, that global inventories are going to rise to, they're expecting 800 million barrels by the end of 2026. There is an upward upside risk to these prices and that is if China starts to accelerate more of their oil stockpiling, then you could see Brent actually a little bit higher than than that at $62 per barrel for the average for 2026. But if you take a look across the board at where Wall Street is expecting oil to land next year, you are seeing JP Morgan that's expecting Brent to average $58 per barrel in 2026. Then you have the EIA that is expecting $51 per barrel in 2026. OPEC Plus has been increasing its production. We see we're seeing this oil surplus and the expectation is a downward trend for oil from here from the fourth quarter of this year and into 2026. They're expecting to see lower oil prices.

                # S&P 500 posts record close, dollar edges up; Nvidia shares down after the bell

                **Body:** By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK (Reuters) -Major stock indexes rose and the S&P 500 posted a record closing high on Wednesday ahead of quarterly results from artificial intelligence leader Nvidia, while the dollar recovered slightly from the previous session’s drop despite ongoing concerns about the U.S. Federal Reserve’s independence.A lawyer for Fed Governor Lisa Cook said she would file a lawsuit against U.S. President Donald Trump after he said he would fire her. Trump’s statement left some investors worried about the independence of the U.S. central bank.Interest-rate sensitive two-year U.S. Treasury yields fell to an almost four-month low and the yield curve steepened as traders weighed the chance that Trump may be able to make more dovish appointments to the Fed.Even so, the dollar traded flat to slightly higher after it dropped in the previous session. The dollar index was last up 0.02% at 98.227, while the euro touched its weakest level since August 6 and was last down 0.09% at $1.1631The three major U.S. stock indexes ended higher.After the closing bell, Nvidia’s shares were down about 3% even as the company forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates.This year, strong gains for a number of technology-related stocks exposed to AI have helped power major equity indexes to record highs and the results were seen as a test of the AI optimism that has propelled markets.“My takeaway is that these (Nvidia) numbers are not unexpected, nor is this reaction," said Nick Frasse, product manager at Vaneck Associates in New York."The market has begun to factor in that Nvidia can continue to beat most expectations in spite of headwinds and questions like what they will have to pay to continue selling to China," he added.The company recently agreed to pay the U.S. federal government 15% of the sales it made in China in exchange for undefined export licenses.Technology shares, including several AI leaders, have wobbled this month with investors pointing to some signs of caution emerging in the sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 147.16 points, or 0.32%, to 45,565.23, the S&P 500 added 15.46 points, or 0.24%, to 6,481.40 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 45.87 points, or 0.21%, to 21,590.14.European stocks rebounded slightly from the previous day’s decline, with investors monitoring political risks in France. Concerns over a potential collapse of French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou’s government next month sparked a selloff of French assets on Tuesday.MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.32 points, or 0.03%, to 953.04. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.1%.Market watchers interpreted Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole symposium last week as indicating interest rate cuts could be on the way. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in 84% odds of a cut in September, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.But the outlook for U.S. interest rates will still likely depend on labor market strength and inflation trends. The two-year note yield was last at 3.625%, down around 5 basis points on the day. The benchmark 10-year note yield fell to 4.236%, the lowest since August 14.The yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes was last at 61.3 basis points after reaching 63.5 basis points, the steepest since April 22.Oil gained on a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude futures rose 90 cents to settle at $64.15 a barrel and Brent futures gained 83 cents to settle at $68.05.Spot gold rose 0.12% to $3,396.34 an ounce.Most investors will find it hard to answer that question with total confidence. Short of a guarantee, which no one can give you, the most successful traders stick to proven best practices without letting hype or hyper-vigilance take over their better judgment.

                # Oil edges up on US crude stocks drop, impact of US tariffs on India

                **Body:** By Arathy SomasekharHOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil prices settled higher on Wednesday after data showed a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude inventories and as investors weighed the potential impact from new U.S. tariffs on India. Brent crude futures were up 83 cents, or 1.2%, at $68.05 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 90 cents, or 1.4%, to $64.15. Both contracts fell by more than 2% on Tuesday.U.S. crude inventories dropped by 2.4 million barrels to 418.3 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.9-million-barrel draw.U.S. gasoline stocks fell by 1.2 million barrels compared with expectations for a 2.2 million-barrel draw. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.8 million barrels versus expectations for an 885,000-barrel rise, the EIA data showed."The gasoline demand number is supportive and shows people are getting ready to travel over the Labor Day weekend. This is the crescendo of the summer driving season, also the last big hurrah for the summertime gasoline blend," said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.U.S. President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50% was also in focus. The tariffs in response to India’s purchases of Russian oil took effect on Wednesday.There was no sign of supply disruption so far, but uncertainty over whether the U.S. will target the oil flows is deterring some traders from taking new positions, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.While the immediate impact of U.S. tariffs on Indian exports appears limited, the ripple effects on the economy pose challenges that must be addressed, India’s Finance Ministry said in its July monthly economic review, released on Wednesday.Russia and Ukraine have also stepped up attacks on each other’s energy infrastructure, worrying traders about supply disruptions.Russia launched a massive drone attack on energy and gas transport infrastructure across six Ukrainian regions overnight, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday. Ukraine struck Russian oil refineries and exporting infrastructure in recent days.U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Tuesday he will meet Ukrainian representatives in New York this week and that Washington is also in talks with Russia in an effort to end the war.Russia has made an upward revision to its crude oil export plan from western ports by 200,000 barrels per day in August from the initial schedule after attacks on its refineries last week, three people close to the matter said on Tuesday.New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said on Wednesday that interest rates will likely fall at some point but policymakers will need to see what upcoming data indicate about the economy before deciding whether it is appropriate to make a cut at the September 16-17 meeting.Lower interest rates can reduce consumer borrowing costs and boost economic growth and demand for oil.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

                **Body:** Investing.com - Bernstein SocGen Group has reiterated an Outperform rating on Tenaris S.A. (NYSE:TS) with a price target of $49.00, citing improved macroeconomic visibility for 2026. The target represents a significant upside from the current price of $36.11, with InvestingPro data showing the stock trading at an attractive P/E ratio of 9.8x and offering a robust 6.2% dividend yield.The research firm noted a shift in tone from Tenaris’s management, observing that the company’s second-quarter 2025 conference call on July 30 conveyed more optimism compared to the cautious stance during first-quarter discussions.Bernstein SocGen highlighted several potential positive catalysts for 2026, including PEMEX securing financing and launching a restructuring process, which suggests drilling activity could gradually recover next year.The firm also pointed to International Energy Agency expectations that Vaca Muerta production could increase by 60,000 barrels in 2026 from approximately 470,000 barrels in 2025, indicating a recovery in fracking activity.Tenaris now anticipates a firm pick-up in offshore activity in 2026, supported by potential offshore Final Investment Decisions in West Africa, East Mediterranean, Latin America, and Asia, according to the research note.In other recent news, Piper Sandler has taken a cautious stance on the Oilfield Services sector, highlighting TechnipFMC as a top pick among its peers. The firm identified TechnipFMC, Tenaris, and Baker Hughes as stocks expected to outperform, despite recent challenges in the oil markets. This analysis comes amid a downturn in oil prices, which has resulted in downward earnings revisions across the industry. The decline in oil prices is partly attributed to increased production by OPEC+ and other macroeconomic factors. Piper Sandler’s outlook is based on their oil price shock playbook, which has been employed to navigate recent market volatility. The firm notes that TechnipFMC has emerged as a relative outperformer, experiencing a smaller decline compared to its peers. The cautious approach reflects the broader challenges faced by the Oilfield Services sector in the current economic climate.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

                # WTI Futures Trade Higher Following Overnight Weakness

                **Body:** WTI Crude oil futures fell yesterday as markets eyed the tariff deadline for India’s purchase of Russian crude. President Trump has threatened India with doubled tariff levels if their buying of Russian crude continues. Markets assumed today that the President would back off the threat, sending Crude lower. Worries over a “sell America” trade persisted through yesterday’s overnight session, with US equities and the Dollar starting the day trading lower. Despite this, a risk-on tone rallied equities back to unchanged, and the Dollar was well off the lows through the US session. Positive US economic data and traders’ focus on NVDA earnings were the primary drivers of the risk-on reversal. Today, crude oil futures are higher by +0.14 [+0.22%] as the India tariffs go into effect with no action out of President Trump. Estimates for today’s EIA report are as follows [thousand barrels]:Crude Oil: -2,000 estimateGasoline: -1,600 estimateDistillate: +500 estimateRefinery Utilization: -0.40%Last night’s API report showed draws of -974 k bbls. Technical Analysis: If prices can gain some footing above 63.40*** through the US session, we’d view this level as a decent buying opportunity. Futures failed at key resistance near the 65.15*** level and busted through two key support levels at 64.20*** and 63.40***. While this came on limited volume, the lack of willing buyers was notable. The false move into July’s trading range was odd, coming on a day with limited news flow or additional new catalysts. These markets are becoming increasingly random and risk-management / position sizing should take precedent for traders. Subscribe to our daily Energy Update for essential insights into Crude Oil and more.

No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.
