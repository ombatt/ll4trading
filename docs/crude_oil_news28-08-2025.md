                **Body:** MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) -Russian oil exports to India are set to rise in September, traders said, as producers cut prices to sell more crude because they cannot process as much in refineries that were damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks on energy infrastructure.India has become the biggest buyer of Russian oil supplies that were displaced by Western sanctions after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. This has allowed Indian refiners to benefit from cheaper crude.But the purchases have drawn condemnation from the government of U.S. President Donald Trump, which increased U.S. tariffs on Indian imports to 50% on Wednesday.New Delhi says it is relying on talks to try to resolve Trump's additional tariffs, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also embarked on a tour to develop diplomatic ties elsewhere, including meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin.U.S. officials have accused India of profiteering from discounted Russian oil, while Indian officials have accused the West of double standards because the European Union and the U.S. still buy Russian goods worth billions of dollars.The Indian oil ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Without India, Russia would struggle to maintain exports at existing levels, and that would cut the oil export revenues that finance the Kremlin's budget and Russia's continued war in Ukraine.Three trading sources involved in oil sales to India said Indian refiners would increase Russian oil purchases in September by 10-20% from August levels, or by 150,000-300,000 barrels per day. The sources, who cited preliminary purchases data, could not be named because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the issue.The two biggest buyers of Russian oil for India, Reliance and Nayara Energy, which is majority Russian-owned, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Russia has more oil to export next month because planned and unplanned refinery outages have cut its capacity to process crude into fuels. Ukraine has attacked 10 Russian refineries in recent days, taking offline as much as 17% of the country's refining capacity.In the first 20 days of August, India imported 1.5 million barrels per day of Russian crude, unchanged from July but slightly below the average of 1.6 million bpd in January-June, according to data from Vortexa analysts.The volumes are equal to around 1.5% of global supply, making India the largest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, which covers some 40% of India's oil needs. China and Turkey are also big buyers of Russian oil.

                **Body:** (Bloomberg) -- Oil fell within its recent narrow band as traders continue to monitor a looming oversupply and US efforts to force India to desist from buying Russian barrels.Brent dropped below $68 a barrel, having traded between $65 and $70 for virtually all of August. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stepped up the pressure on New Delhi to halt purchases of Russian oil after Washington doubled a levy on imports from the country to 50%. The US has singled out India over Russian crude imports as part of its efforts to end the war in Ukraine.Most Read from BloombergTo Boost Housing, Chicago Kills Parking MinimumsCentral Glasgow Could Be Poised for a RevivalChicago Schools’ Late Pension Payment Magnifies Fiscal MessNY Penn Station’s Long-Awaited Revamp to Start Work in 2027Trump Administration to Take Control of DC’s Union StationAt the same time, Ukraine has ramped up drone attacks on Russia’s oil infrastructure, hitting two more refineries after a run of recent strikes. Moscow’s crude exports slipped last week, tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed, after Ukraine intensified its attacks.“Tariffs and sanctions related to Russia, as well as attacks on Russian oil facilities have kept oil prices resilient in the high $60s, despite the looming oversupply that should lower prices,” Citigroup analysts including Anthony Yuen said in a note.While a surplus is widely expected toward the end of the year as supplies swell from both inside and outside the OPEC+ alliance, its impact on the market remains uncertain. Bank of America Corp. said on Wednesday that the availability of about a billion barrels of spare tank space means it’s possible that the extra supplies could be absorbed fairly comfortably.Against that backdrop, there’s been some weakness in the Brent market over recent days, after a run of cargo offers in the key North Sea pricing window.

                # U.S. stock futures edged higher; second-quarter GDP, Nvidia earnings in focus

                **Body:** Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures edged higher Thursday, with investors digesting new U.S. growth data as well as results from artificial intelligence major Nvidia  (NASDAQ:NVDA). At 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT), Dow Jones Futures rose 85 points, or 0.2% and S&P 500 Futures gained 7 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.1%. The major indices enjoyed a winning session Wednesday, with the broad-based S&P 500 hitting a record close.They are on pace to record monthly gains, as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite are each up more than 2%, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 3% in the period.Nvidia reported a beat to analysts’ quarterly estimates late Wednesday and the chip designer and AI bellwether forecasted third-quarter revenue that was higher than Wall Street estimates. However, a miss on data centre revenue and questions over China forecasts caused investors to question the company’s elevated valuation, resulting in its shares sliding in after-hours trading.Notably, Nvidia said there were no sales of H20 chips to China during the quarter, nor did the company assume any shipments in its guidance. Chip stocks came under a bit of pressure in sympathy, with AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) all retreating.Among other tech movers, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell premarket as its current quarter guidance missed expectations, while data cloud company Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) soared after it hiked its annual product revenue guidance.  U.S. stocks had rallied on a mostly positive second-quarter earnings season and increasing bets on a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.But this rally was seen cooling through late-August, amid emerging doubts over the Fed’s plans, as well as a sharp drop in technology shares.That said, expectations of a Fed interest rate cut in September rose after Fed Governor John Williams said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that "every meeting is, from my perspective, live.""Risks are more in balance," he said. "We are going to just have to see how the data play out."Data released earlier Thursday showed that the U.S. economy expanded by more than initially reported in the second quarter, with gross domestic product growing by 3.3% during the April to June period, according to the second estimate from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.The initial estimate had suggested that the U.S. economy grew by 3.0% in the first quarter, after contracting by 0.5% in the first quarter.The focus will also be on the PCE price index on Friday - the Fed’s preferred inflation measure - and the monthly payrolls report a week later.Oil prices fell on expectations for lower U.S. fuel demand as the summer driving season draws near, even after a sharp drop in U.S. crude inventories.At 08:45 ET, Brent futures slipped 0.3% to $67.22 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.3% to $63.94 a barrel.Both contracts climbed in the prior session after the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended August 22, a larger draw than the 1.9 million barrels forecast by analysts.The drop signaled strong demand ahead of the upcoming U.S. Labor Day long weekend. However, this typically marks the unofficial end of the summer driving season and the onset of lower U.S. demand.Ambar Warrick contributed to this article   Futures retreated after a mildly positive session on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 hit a record high on some gains in technology shares.But tech stocks drifted lower in aftermarket trade, led chiefly by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the chipmaker’s data center revenue missed expectations amid heightened uncertainty over China. Most investors will find it hard to answer that question with total confidence. Short of a guarantee, which no one can give you, the most successful traders stick to proven best practices without letting hype or hyper-vigilance take over their better judgment.

                # Oil falls as end of driving season looms, Druzhba restarts

                **Body:** By Alex LawlerLONDON (Reuters) -Oil fell on Thursday after rising in the previous session, pressured by expectations of lower U.S. fuel demand at the end of the summer travel season and by the restart of Russian supply to Hungary and Slovakia through the Druzhba pipeline.Crude had risen on Wednesday after official data showed U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended August 22, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.9-million-barrel draw, a sign of strong demand.However, oil market participants see the upcoming U.S. Labor Day long weekend as the unofficial end of the summer driving season, and the onset of lower U.S. demand for gasoline.Brent crude futures dropped 8 cents, or 0.1%, to $67.97 at 1156 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures was down 4 cents at $64.11."This weekend’s U.S. bank holiday marks the end of the driving season and gasoline has hardly been the panacea hoped for in terms of demand," said John Evans of oil broker PVM."Any short-term reasons to be friendly towards oil prices are diminishing," he added, citing the Druzhba resumption.Russian crude supplies to Hungary and Slovakia through the Druzhba pipeline have restarted after an outage caused by a Ukrainian attack in Russia last week, Hungarian oil company MOL and Slovakia’s economy minister said on Thursday.Traders are also watching out for how New Delhi responds to pressure from Washington to stop buying Russian oil, after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50% on Wednesday."India is expected to continue purchasing crude oil from Russia at least in the short term, which should limit the impact of the new tariffs on global supply," IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.Lending some support to prices, Russia and Ukraine have stepped up attacks on each other’s energy infrastructure.Russia launched a massive drone attack on energy and gas transport infrastructure across six Ukrainian regions overnight, leaving more than 100,000 people without power, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday.The best opportunities often hide in plain sight—buried among thousands of stocks you'd never have time to research individually.

                # Exclusive-India’s Russian oil imports set to rise in September in defiance of US

                **Body:** MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) -Russian oil exports to India are set to rise in September, traders said, as producers cut prices to sell more crude because they cannot process as much in refineries that were damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks on energy infrastructure.India has become the biggest buyer of Russian oil supplies that were displaced by Western sanctions after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. This has allowed Indian refiners to benefit from cheaper crude. But the purchases have drawn condemnation from the government of U.S. President Donald Trump, which increased U.S. tariffs on Indian imports to 50% on Wednesday. New Delhi says it is relying on talks to try to resolve Trump’s additional tariffs, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also embarked on a tour to develop diplomatic ties elsewhere, including meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin.  U.S. officials have accused India of profiteering from discounted Russian oil, while Indian officials have accused the West of double standards because the European Union and the U.S. still buy Russian goods worth billions of dollars.The Indian oil ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Without India, Russia would struggle to maintain exports at existing levels, and that would cut the oil export revenues that finance the Kremlin’s budget and Russia’s continued war in Ukraine.Three trading sources involved in oil sales to India said Indian refiners would increase Russian oil purchases in September by 10-20% from August levels, or by 150,000-300,000 barrels per day.

China and Turkey are also big buyers of Russian oil.INDIA SET TO CARRY ON BUYING?India’s increased buying of Russian oil over recent years has been to the detriment of more expensive supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC’s share edged up in 2024 after an eight-year drop.Russian exporters sold Urals crude loading in September at discounts of $2–$3 per barrel to benchmark dated Brent, the three traders said.The levels are cheaper than discounts of $1.50 per barrel in August, which were the narrowest since 2022, the traders said."Unless India issues a clear policy directive or trade economics shift significantly, Russian crude will likely remain a core part of its supply mix," said Sumit Ritolia from Kpler.Brokerage CLSA in a note also predicted only "a limited chance of India stopping Russian imports" unless a global ban is imposed.It also said that if Indian imports of Russian crude were halted, the knock-on impact could be to reduce global supplies by around one million bpd and lead to a short-term spike in global prices to nearly $100 a barrel.Traders said the full impact of sanctions and tariffs may only be visible in cargoes arriving to India in October, which will begin to trade in the next few days.In addition to the U.S. tariffs, the European Union has also tightened its price cap designed to limit Russia’s oil revenues, which will complicate sales later this year.The EU has set the cap at $47.60 per barrel from September 2 - 15% below the Russian crude market price - restricting access to Western services for cargoes sold above the cap.With RELI making headlines, savvy investors are asking: Is it truly valued fairly?

                # Nvidia’s results, Tesla’s European sales, Japan trade - what’s moving markets
                **Date:** 2025-08-28T07:09:27+00:00
                **Source:** investing
                **Body:** Investing.com - U.S. stock futures traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, with Nvidia’s results weighing on the tech sector. Tesla’s sales in Europe continued to slump in July, while doubts have emerged about the trade deal between Japan and the U.S. after Tokyo’s main negotiator cancels a trip to Washington.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) delivered strong quarterly results after the market close Wednesday, with the chip designer and AI bellwether reporting a beat to analysts’ estimates and forecasting third-quarter revenue that was higher than Wall Street estimates. However, a miss on data centre revenue and questions over China forecasts caused investors to question the company’s elevated valuation, resulting in its shares sliding in after-hours trading.The stock dip removed around $110 billion from Nvidia’s $4.4 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings – $1.04 per share– beat expectations of $1.01, as did revenue, at $46.7 billion, while it forecast current quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, which is higher than expectations of $52.76 billion.But Nvidia’s data center revenue, which is by far its biggest breadwinner, came in at $41.1 billion, missing estimates of $41.34 billion. The miss largely stemmed from Nvidia selling no H20 chips in China during the quarter.CEO Jensen Huang expects permission to restart selling Nvidia’s chips to China after striking a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to pay commissions to the U.S. government. But with no formal U.S. rules in place and questions about whether Chinese regulators will discourage purchases of Nvidia chips, the AI market bellwether excluded potential China sales from the forecast for the current quarter.Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company will ship between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue in the current quarter, if geopolitical issues were to subside. But the outlook on China still remained highly uncertain. U.S. stock futures traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq underperforming after the release of results from AI darling Nvidia. At 02:55 ET (06:55 GMT), the S&P 500 futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher and Dow futures rose 127 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 17 points, or 0.1%.The major indices enjoyed a winning session Wednesday, with the broad-based S&P 500 hitting a record close. They are on pace to record monthly gains, as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite are each up more than 2%, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 3% in the period.Aside from Nvidia’s results, investors will also digest numbers from the likes of Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), while the economic data calendar includes the release of weekly initial jobless claims and gross domestic product growth for the second quarter.Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) sales and market share in Europe fell sharply in July, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association showed on Thursday, even as broader electric vehicle sales in the region continued to increase.Tesla’s sales lagged those of Chinese rival BYD, which was included in the monthly sales data for the first time. The latter also seized a greater market share than Tesla. Tesla’s total new car registrations in the European Union, the Europe Free Trade Association, and in the U.K., slid just over 40% year-on-year, ACEA data showed. The ACEA is a group of 15 European automakers that acts as the main lobbying and standards group for the bloc’s automobile industry. Tesla’s market share in the region shrank further to 0.8% from 1.4% year-on-year, while its January-July sales declined by 33.6% from the same period last year. The drop came even as total battery EV sales in Europe surged 33.6% in July. The sector now represents about 15.6% of the European car market, behind the 28.3% share held by petrol vehicles and 34.7% share held by hybrid EVs. Tesla’s updated Model Y, released earlier this year, has made little impact on its sales, while rival offerings from European automakers, who have jumped on the EV bandwagon in recent years, also provided increased competition. Tesla’s brand image has taken a hit in Europe, hurt by CEO Elon Musk’s endorsement of U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as his associations with a German far right party. Japan’s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, has cancelled a visit to the United States at the last minute, delaying talks designed to finalise a $550 billion investment package offered by Tokyo in exchange for relief on punishing tariffs."It was found that there are points that need to be discussed at the administrative level during coordination with the American side. Therefore, the trip has been cancelled," Japan’s government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters on Thursday.Washington and Tokyo agreed in July to set a reduced 15% tariff on imports from Japan in exchange for the package of U.S.-bound investment through government-backed loans and guarantees, but details of its contents remain unclear.While Trump has touted the package as "our money to invest" and said the U.S. would retain 90% of the profits earned, Japanese officials have stressed that the investments will be determined based on whether they will also benefit Japan.Oil prices fell on expectations for lower U.S. fuel demand as the summer driving season draws near, even after a sharp drop in U.S. crude inventories.At 02:55 ET, Brent futures slipped 0.5% to $66.91 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.9% to $63.59 a barrel.Both contracts climbed in the prior session after the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended August 22, a larger draw than the 1.9 million barrels forecast by analysts.The drop signaled strong demand ahead of the upcoming U.S. Labor Day long weekend.

                **Body:** Investing.com-- Oil prices fell in Asian trading on Thursday after U.S. data showed a slightly sharper-than-expected drop in crude inventories, while investors weighed the impact of additional U.S. tariffs against India, which came into effect a day earlier.As of 21:34 ET (01:34 GMT), Brent Oil Futures expiring in October fell 0.5% to $67.71 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures declined 0.6% to $63.80 per barrel.U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 2.4 million barrels in the week to Aug. 22, a larger draw than the 1.9 million barrels forecast by analysts, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.Gasoline inventories declined by 1.2 million barrels, and distillate stocks dropped by 1.8 million barrels, while implied gasoline demand rose to 9.24 million barrels per day from 8.84 million bpd a week earlier, pointing to solid seasonal consumption. The figures indicated strong end-of-summer driving activity but also raised concerns that, once the seasonal peak passes, demand could weaken, leaving refiners with slimmer margins and the crude market vulnerable to softer consumption. While tighter inventories would normally support prices, oil futures eased as investors weighed the risk that the end of the summer travel season could cap demand going forward, tempering the bullish impact of the stock draw.In a move tied to India’s aggression in buying Russian crude, an additional 25% U.S. tariff on Indian imports took effect on Wednesday, doubling the total duty to 50% starting August 27. This step is part of broader pressure aimed at curbing India’s ties with Russia amid the Ukraine war.Indian refiners briefly paused Russian oil purchases after secondary tariffs were imposed, but have since resumed buying, with the measures proving insufficient to curb flows.Analysts believe the market will be cautiously watching Russian oil flows to India closely going forward to gauge the impact.The conflict in Ukraine also remains one of the main drivers of market sentiment. U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to position himself as a mediator, but last week warned he would impose fresh sanctions on Moscow if no progress was made toward a peace deal within two weeks.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.

                # Stocks mixed as investors digest US GDP, Nvidia earnings

                **Body:** Stock markets fluctuated on Thursday as investors digested stronger-than-estimated US economic growth and record earnings at AI chip giant Nvidia.The broad-base S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq opened higher but the Dow was flat.Shares in Nvidia were down around one percent despite posting a profit of $26.4 billion on record revenue of $46.7 billion in the second quarter.Investors had keenly awaited the earnings update late Wednesday from the California-based firm, whose robust growth has largely driven strong gains for tech stocks in recent months.Its shares fell, however, as important data centre revenue declined.The earnings report comes amid market worries over a spending bubble in the artificial intelligence sector that could burst and hurt the chip giant's fortunes."The market seems to be asking whether Nvidia can keep up this pace as competition intensifies and AI enthusiasm starts to look a little overbought," said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at traders Scope Markets.Investors were also reacting to US data showing that the world's biggest economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter, up from an initial estimate of 3.0 percent in July."After the initial release, there were concerns that the domestic economy was slowing quite sharply," said Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm."But these latest data suggest that the economy is a bit stronger than initially feared," he said.The upward revision mainly reflected improvements in investment and consumer spending, the Commerce Department said.But overall, growth in the second quarter was also bolstered by a fall in US imports, which are subtracted from the GDP.This drop came as businesses pulled back on shipments after rushing to stock up ahead of US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes.The data could offer insight into the outlook for US interest rates, with the Federal Reserve eyeing further cuts to borrowing costs in a bid to boost the US economy."Overall, this release probably doesn't change Federal Reserve thinking too much," Flax said, adding that the central bank was still expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting."But a stronger than expected result from domestic demand suggests that there might not be that much scope to cut rates over the next 12 months."In Europe, the Paris stock market extended its recovery, having tumbled early in the week on fears that France's minority government could be toppled.This was after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou proposed a confidence vote over his proposed budget cuts.

                **Body:** (Bloomberg) -- Oil was little changed within its recent narrow band as traders continue to monitor a looming oversupply and US efforts to force India to desist from buying Russian barrels.Brent nudged below $68 a barrel, having traded between $65 and $70 for virtually all of August. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stepped up the pressure on New Delhi to halt purchases of Russian oil after Washington doubled a levy on imports from the country to 50%. The US has singled out India over Russian crude imports as part of its efforts to end the war in Ukraine.Most Read from BloombergTo Boost Housing, Chicago Kills Parking MinimumsCentral Glasgow Could Be Poised for a RevivalChicago Schools’ Late Pension Payment Magnifies Fiscal MessNY Penn Station’s Long-Awaited Revamp to Start Work in 2027Trump Administration to Take Control of DC’s Union StationAt the same time, Ukraine has ramped up drone attacks on Russia’s oil infrastructure, hitting two more refineries after a run of recent strikes. Moscow’s crude exports slipped last week, tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed, after Ukraine intensified its attacks.Oil markets are widely expected to move into a surplus toward the end of the year, as higher output from the OPEC+ alliance and outside of the grouping overwhelms demand. The producer group is next due to meet on Sept. 7 but no talks have been held yet about its next moves, according to a senior OPEC delegate.“Tariffs and sanctions related to Russia, as well as attacks on Russian oil facilities have kept oil prices resilient in the high $60s, despite the looming oversupply that should lower prices,” Citigroup analysts including Anthony Yuen said in a note.While a surplus is widely expected toward the end of the year, its impact on the market remains uncertain. Bank of America Corp. said on Wednesday that the availability of about a billion barrels of spare tank space means it’s possible that the extra supplies could be absorbed fairly comfortably.Against that backdrop, there’s been some weakness in the Brent market over recent days, after a run of cargo offers in the key North Sea pricing window.

                # U.S. stocks edged lower; Q2 GDP rose more than expected, Nvidia disappoints

                **Body:** Investing.com-- U.S. stocks edged lower Thursday, trading either side of the flatline, as investors digested new U.S. growth data as well as results from artificial intelligence major Nvidia  (NASDAQ:NVDA). At 09:55 ET (13:55 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 75 points, or 0.2%, lower, the S&P 500 index dropped 10 points, or 0.2%, and NASDAQ Composite slipped 45 points, or 0.2%. The major indices on pace to record monthly gains, as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite were each up more than 2% before Thursday’s action, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained up more than 3% in the period.Nvidia reported a beat to analysts’ quarterly estimates late Wednesday and the chip designer and AI bellwether forecasted third-quarter revenue that was higher than Wall Street estimates. However, a miss on data centre revenue and questions over China forecasts caused investors to question the company’s elevated valuation, resulting in its shares sliding lower.Notably, Nvidia said there were no sales of H20 chips to China during the quarter, nor did the company assume any shipments in its guidance. Chip stocks came under a bit of pressure in sympathy, with AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) all retreating.Among other tech movers, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell as its current quarter guidance missed expectations, while data cloud company Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) soared after it hiked its annual product revenue guidance.  Jack Daniel’s maker Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb) beat estimates for first-quarter sales, on the back of steady demand for its ready-to-drink beverages and spirits.Bath & Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) missed estimates for second-quarter profit, hurt by higher costs at a time when the retailer grapples with uncertain discretionary consumer spending.Dollar General (NYSE:DG) raised its annual sales and profit forecasts, banking on steady demand from cost-conscious consumers across income brackets in the United States amid tariff and inflation concerns.U.S. stocks had rallied on a mostly positive second-quarter earnings season and increasing bets on a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.But this rally was seen cooling through late-August, amid emerging doubts over the Fed’s plans, as well as a sharp drop in technology shares.That said, expectations of a Fed interest rate cut in September rose after Fed Governor John Williams said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that "every meeting is, from my perspective, live.""Risks are more in balance," he said. "We are going to just have to see how the data play out."Data released earlier Thursday showed that the U.S. economy expanded by more than initially reported in the second quarter, with gross domestic product growing by 3.3% during the April to June period, according to the second estimate from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.The initial estimate had suggested that the U.S. economy grew by 3.0% in the first quarter, after contracting by 0.5% in the first quarter.The focus will also be on the PCE price index on Friday - the Fed’s preferred inflation measure - and the monthly payrolls report a week later.Oil prices fell on expectations for lower U.S. fuel demand as the summer driving season draws near, even after a sharp drop in U.S. crude inventories.At 09:55 ET, Brent futures slipped 0.4% to $67.14 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.5% to $63.81 a barrel.Both contracts climbed in the prior session after the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended August 22, a larger draw than the 1.9 million barrels forecast by analysts.The drop signaled strong demand ahead of the upcoming U.S. Labor Day long weekend. However, this typically marks the unofficial end of the summer driving season and the onset of lower U.S. demand.Ambar Warrick contributed to this article   Futures retreated after a mildly positive session on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 hit a record high on some gains in technology shares.But tech stocks drifted lower in aftermarket trade, led chiefly by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the chipmaker’s data center revenue missed expectations amid heightened uncertainty over China. Most investors will find it hard to answer that question with total confidence.

                **Body:** By Alex LawlerLONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices edged lower on Thursday after rising in the previous session, pressured by expectations of lower U.S. fuel demand at the end of the summer travel season and by the restart of Russian supply to Hungary and Slovakia through the Druzhba pipeline.Crude had risen on Wednesday after official data showed U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended August 22, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.9-million-barrel draw, a sign of strong demand.However, oil market participants see the upcoming U.S. Labor Day long weekend as the unofficial end of the summer driving season, and the onset of lower U.S. demand for gasoline.Brent crude futures were down 11 cents, or nearly 0.2%, to $67.94 at 1312 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 7 cents at $64.08."This weekend’s U.S. bank holiday marks the end of the driving season and gasoline has hardly been the panacea hoped for in terms of demand," said John Evans of oil broker PVM."Any short-term reasons to be friendly towards oil prices are diminishing," he added, citing the Druzhba resumption.Russian crude supplies to Hungary and Slovakia through the Druzhba pipeline have restarted after an outage caused by a Ukrainian attack in Russia last week, Hungarian oil company MOL and Slovakia’s economy minister said on Thursday.Traders are also watching out for how New Delhi responds to pressure from Washington to stop buying Russian oil, after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50% on Wednesday."India is expected to continue purchasing crude oil from Russia at least in the short term, which should limit the impact of the new tariffs on global supply," IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.Lending some support to prices, Russia and Ukraine have stepped up attacks on each other’s energy infrastructure.Russia launched a massive drone attack on energy and gas transport infrastructure across six Ukrainian regions overnight to Wednesday, leaving more than 100,000 people without power, Ukrainian officials said.AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
